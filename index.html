title: My list of secure messaging apps
---
My list of secure messaging apps.  Below are applications that offer end to end encryption.<br>
<br>
Corrections and additions are welcome, either by an Issue ticket or a Pull Request on the <a href="https://github.com/Perelandra0x309/secure-im">github project page</a>.<br>
<br>
<h2>My current top picks:</h2><br>
Criteria:
<ul>
<li>This list is focused on instant messaging and chatting as the primary usage of the app</li>
<li>Open source</li>
<li>Multiple platforms preferred</li>
</ul>
SMS:
<ul>
<li>{% include generate_app_link.html app_name="signal" %}<br>
OK let's get this one out of the way first.  If you have a phone, there's almost no way to get away from SMS.  So the best thing you can do is protect your SMS messages at rest with encryption.  Signal also offers excellent end to end encryption between Signal users.  One draw back of Signal is that everyone you connect with will know your phone number.  For people you are comfortable knowing your phone number that is fine, but for those you don't want to give out your number to...<br>
</li>
</ul>
<br>
Messaging apps to use without giving out your phone number:
<ul>
  <li>Federated or Centralized:</li>
  <ul>
    <li>{% include generate_app_link.html app_name="threema" %} (partially open source)</li>
    <li>{% include generate_app_link.html app_name="xmpp" %}</li>
    <li>{% include generate_app_link.html app_name="keybase" %}</li>
    <li>{% include generate_app_link.html app_name="riot" %} (E2EE still in beta)</li>
  </ul>
  
  <li>P2P:</li>
  <ul>
    <li>{% include generate_app_link.html app_name="ricochet" %} (desktop only)</li>
    <li>{% include generate_app_link.html app_name="tox" %} (I had some usability issues and crashing with some clients)</li>
  </ul>
</ul>
<br>
If you're not so strict about being open source try:
<ul>
  <li>{% include generate_app_link.html app_name="safeswiss" %}- P2P, not open source but based in Switzerland</li>
  <li>{% include generate_app_link.html app_name="twinme" %}- P2P, not open source, based in France</li>
  <li>{% include generate_app_link.html app_name="eleet" %}- I am really liking this one, unfortunately not open source and based in the UK</li>
</ul>
<br>
