title: My list of secure messaging apps
---
My list of secure messaging apps.  Below are applications that offer end to end encryption.<br>
<br>
Corrections and additions are welcome, either by an Issue ticket or a Pull Request on the <a href="https://github.com/Perelandra0x309/secure-im">github project page</a>.<br>
<br>
<h2>My current top picks:</h2><br>
Criteria:
<ul>
  <li>This list is focused on instant messaging and chatting as the primary usage of the app</li>
  <li>Clients on multiple platforms preferred</li>
  <li>Does not expose your phone number or email address to other users</li>
  <li>Does not leak data (pictures or other data saved unencrypted in browseable folders)</li>
  <li>Has ephemeral messages (encryption keys destroyed after a set time)</li>
  <li>Has contact verification</li>
  <li>Testing done on both Android and iOS when possible.  See my <a href="#testing">testing setup</a></li>
</ul>
SMS:
<ul>
  <li>{% include generate_app_link.html app_name="signal" %}<br>
    OK let's get this one out of the way first.  If you have a phone, there's almost no way to get away from SMS.  So the best thing you can do is protect your SMS messages at rest with encryption.  Signal also offers excellent end to end encryption between Signal users.  One draw back of Signal is that everyone you connect with will know your phone number, but for people you are comfortable knowing your phone number that is fine.<br>
  </li>
  <li>Runner up: {% include generate_app_link.html app_name="silence" %}<br>
    If you don't want to use Signal as a messaging app then I recommend getting Silence just for SMS messages.  It will locally encrypt the SMS database on your phone.  You can also send encrypted SMS messages to other Silence users.  Since Silence only uses SMS it is not dependent on any servers like Signal is.
</ul>
<br>
Messaging apps listed here do not expose you phone number or email address.  Notes within [brackets] are potential negative attributes:
<ul>
  <li>Top Tier Recommendations:</li>
  <ul>
    <li>{% include generate_app_link.html app_name="wire" %}- [Beware of possible high battery usage on older Android versions or Android forks without Play Services]</li>
    <li>{% include generate_app_link.html app_name="wickrme" %}- All messages expire [Based in USA]</li>
    <li>{% include generate_app_link.html app_name="safeswiss" %}- P2P, based in Switzerland</li>
  </ul>
  <li>Second Tier (misses some criteria):</li>
  <ul>
    <li>{% include generate_app_link.html app_name="threema" %}- P2P, based in Switzerland [No PFS or ephemeral messages]</li>
    <li>{% include generate_app_link.html app_name="twinme" %}- P2P, based in Germany [No ephemeral messages or contact verification]</li>
     <li>{% include generate_app_link.html app_name="eleet" %}- [Based in the UK, no contact verification]</li>
  </ul>

  <li>Third Tier (keep an eye on these):</li>
  <ul>
    <li>{% include generate_app_link.html app_name="briar" %}- P2P, can use Tor [Android only, text only, no ephemeral messages]</li>
    <li>{% include generate_app_link.html app_name="ricochet" %}- P2P, uses Tor [Desktop only, text only, no contact verification]</li>
    <li>{% include generate_app_link.html app_name="keybase" %}- [Based in USA, only &quot;exploding&quot; messages are PFS, no contact verification]</li>
    <li>{% include generate_app_link.html app_name="riot" %}- [E2EE still in beta, Based in the UK, no ephemeral messages]</li>
    <li>{% include generate_app_link.html app_name="tungsten" %}- New app still in beta but this shows lots of promise.  Uses the TOR network for anonymous profiles, synchronizes across multiple devices, multiple personas, based in Germany. [No ephemeral messages or contact verification]</li>
    <li>{% include generate_app_link.html app_name="babelnet" %}- Very nice syncing between multiple devices, based outside of the 14 eyes [User interface needs clarified wording, trouble connecting with LineageOS]</li>
    <li>{% include generate_app_link.html app_name="conversations" %} or {% include generate_app_link.html app_name="pixart" %}- Based in Germany [Android Only, no ephemeral messages]</li>

<br>
<p>To investigate:</p>
<li>Any apps that I wish to investigate are now entered as an <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/Perelandra0x309/secure-im/issues">issue ticket here</a>.</li><br>

<a name="testing"></a>
<p>My testing setup:</p>
I test on iOS, Android, MacOS and web applications.  Keep in mind that even though you may be using one platform, the other person you are communicating with may be using a different platform.  iOS is generally more secure than Android, simply because the application data is very well segregated at the OS level, so that apps cannot access the data of other apps.  However this is not the case with Android, each application written for Android must ensure it does not save any data to globally accessible local storage.  So when I test apps I scrutinize the Android version very closely to looks for any data leakage. So even if an iOS version of an app does not leak data, if the Android version does I consider the entire app system compromised.<br>
My test devices:
<ul>
  <li>Motorola G4 Play with stock Android 7.1.1</li>
  <li>iPhone 5S with iOS 12.1</li>
</ul>
For apps that require a phone number I use two VOIP numbers that have SMS capability so I don't use my primary phone number.  One is through the MySudo app on iOS, and the other is through <a target="_blank" href="https://jmp.chat">JMP.chat</a>.  These are only available in the US/Canada.<br>
