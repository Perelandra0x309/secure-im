You do not need to provide any personal information to signup for a Threema account.<br>
<br>
Visit the <a href="https://threema.ch/en/download" class="btn btn--success btn--x-large" target="_blank">Threema download page</a> where you can get it for iOS, Android or Windows phone.  It does cost a one time fee of $2.95 or &euro;2,60 but this is well worth it to support the work of this group.  There are no further costs after installing this app. If you are using Android also install the free QR Scanner plugin.<br>

<tr><td>"Threema Safe" is an easy way to backup your Threema key.  If you lose or break your phone you will need a backup of your ID to restore your account information.  I recommend using this, be sure to choose a good strong password and record the password somewhere not on your phone.  You will need the password to restore your ID on another phone.<br>Touch the green arrow to continue.</td>
