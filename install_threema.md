You do not need to provide any personal information to signup for a Threema account.<br>
<br>
Visit the <a href="https://threema.ch/en/download" class="btn btn--success btn--x-large" target="_blank">Threema download page</a> where you can get it for iOS, Android or Windows phone.  It does cost a one time fee of $2.95 or &euro;2,60 but this is well worth it to support the work of this group.  There are no further costs after installing this app. If you are using Android also install the free QR Scanner plugin.<br>
<br>
When you first open the app you will be asked if you want to enter an email address.  This is optional, so you may leave this section blank and continue to create a completely anonymous profile.  You will then be asked to move your finger around the screen to create random data that will be used for creating a unique encryption key for your device.  Your unique ID will be made up of 8 numbers and letters.  This is what you will give to whoever you wish to communicate with.  Or you may also scan QR codes to add someone as a contact in Threema.<br>
<br>
<h2>Backup your ID</h2><br>
One of the first things you should do is backup your Threema ID, this contains the key to be able to decrypt all your messages.  If you lose your phone or need to reinstall the app, without a backup all your data will be lost and you will need to create a new identity.  This would be inconvenient for everyone you have connected with.  To make a backup touch the 3 bars in the top left corner of the app and select "My Backups".  You have two options for a backup method.  The first one, "Threema Safe" is the easiest.  This will create a backup and save it on a Threema server.  The backup is encrypted with a password of your choosing so it should be safe from anyone getting access to it, but some people might have reservations about saving their keys on a server.  The second option is the "Data Backup", which will create the backup on your device.  It is your responsibility to move this backup to another safe location such as a personal computer so that you can use this backup if your device is ever lost or broken.<br>
