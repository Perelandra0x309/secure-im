<p>To investigate:</p>
<li>Any apps that I wish to investigate are now entered as an <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/Perelandra0x309/secure-im/issues">issue ticket here</a>.</li><br>
<br>
<a name="testing"></a>
<p>My testing setup:</p>
I test on iOS, Android, MacOS and web applications.  Keep in mind that even though you may be using one platform, the other person you are communicating with may be using a different platform.  iOS is generally more secure than Android, simply because the application data is very well segregated at the OS level, so that apps cannot access the data of other apps.  However this is not the case with Android, each application written for Android must ensure it does not save any data to globally accessible local storage.  So when I test apps I scrutinize the Android version very closely to looks for any data leakage. So even if an iOS version of an app does not leak data, if the Android version does I consider the entire app system compromised.<br>
My test devices:
<ul>
  <li>Motorola G4 Play with stock Android 7.1.1</li>
  <li>iPhone 5S with iOS 12.1</li>
</ul>
For apps that require a phone number I use two VOIP numbers that have SMS capability so I don't use my primary phone number.  One is through the MySudo app on iOS, and the other is through <a target="_blank" href="https://jmp.chat">JMP.chat</a>.  These are only available in the US/Canada.<br>
