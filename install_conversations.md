First you need to choose a server to host your XMPP account.  This is like choosing an email provider.  Here are some lists of servers to look at, some have ratings on each server as well:

<br>
Each server has it's own privacy policy and requirements to signup.  Some require an email address and other don't.<br>
<br>
Once you have signed up at the website of an XMPP provider of your choice, now you can install Conversations.  One option is to purchase it at the Google Play store, you can find a link to do so at the official <a href="https://conversations.im" {{ site.class_button_external }} target="_blank">Conversations.im website</a>.  
Or you can download a free version from <a href="https://f-droid.org/en/packages/eu.siacs.conversations/" {{ site.class_button_external }} target="_blank">FDroid</a>.<br>
