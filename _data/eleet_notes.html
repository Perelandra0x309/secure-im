Eleet is very easy to setup and there is no requirement for an email or phone number.  To add a contact 
you need to acquire their Eleet ID or scan their QR code.  In chats you can see an indicator when someone is typing. 
Encrypted group chats are very easy to create.  Group chats have the option to be anonymous (where 
you will not see anyone's ID only their nickname), and/or temporary where the group chat will be deleted 
from everyone's device at a specified time.<br>
One very nice feature is the ability to create private IDs, which are in addition to your primary ID. 
These private IDs are not linked in any way to your primary one.  Each private ID has a separate list 
of contacts and chats, and they are all accessible without needing to log in and out.<br>
The desktop clients will sync up all messages so you can transition between devices and see all messages.
