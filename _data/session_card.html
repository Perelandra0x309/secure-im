<p>Session runs on top of the onion routing network <a href="https://docs.loki.network/Lokinet/LokinetOverview/">Lokinet</a> to provide a decentralized messaging system.  It uses the Signal protocol for end to end message encryption.  This is a new project so is still considered experimental and there will be bugs in the apps.  However in testing the app it has been overall a great experience and I think is one of the best prospects for becoming an offical recommendation on my list.</p>
<br>
Pros:
<ul>
<li>Send text, photos and files in individual or group chats</li>
<li>The Lokinet system ensures your messages are not stored on any single server while in transit</li>
<li>Set emphemeral message timeout for up to one week</li>
<li>No personal information such as an email address or phone number is needed to create an account</li>
<li>Available for iOS, Android, Linux, MacOS and Windows</li>
<li>Battery usage on mobile devices is better than some other onion routing based apps</li>
</ul>
Cons:
<ul>
<li>Accounts can only be used on a single device, multi-device support is planned for the future</li>
<li>Still new, bugs exists and features may change</li>
</ul>
Other features:
<ul>
<li>Add contacts via a QR code</li>
<li>Typing indicators and read receipts (can be turned on or off)</li>
<li>Create closed private groups or open public groups</li>
<li>Mobile app has lockout feature</li>
<li>Disable link previews in messages</li>
<li>Turn notification via Google notification servers on or off</li>

</ul>
