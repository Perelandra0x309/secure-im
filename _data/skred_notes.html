Skred is actually a rebranded TwinMe app.  It is essentially identical except for it is missing the music sharing feature.  This might be worth trying and is certainly useable, but you might as well just use TwinMe which has more features.  Skred is also based in France which is in the 9 eyes countries.<br>
