Skred is a variant of the TwinMe app with most of the same features.  One additional function is that the alternate identities are secured with a PIN number.  Each identity has its own profile, contacts and conversations.  When the default identity in use the contacts, conversations and notifications from the other identities are not shown so the alternate identities are truly secret and silent unless you are actively using one.<br>
