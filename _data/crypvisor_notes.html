Crypvisor is unique messaging application that uses a public blockchain to store half of the public key of all users.  This is claimed to prevent man in the middle attacks because the integrity of the public key can be verified against the blockchain.<br>
Each chat can be password protected or hidden with a password.  Individual messages or the entire chat can be deleted on both sides.  The application interface is nicely done and is easy to navigate.<br>
The are Crypvisor tokens (CVT) that you can send to others within the applications.<br>
During testing there was a message that appeared to be sent, but it was never received.  And on longer messages the timer status icon was too far to the left on the screen and partially cut off so that you cannot see the count down time.<br>
<br>
My verdict: Interesting<br>
<br>
The use of blockchain is a good effort to try to ensure integrity of a public key, however I am not sure why only half of the key is stored in blockchain, and not the entire key?  Also it would still be nice to have contact verification via some key fingerprint as a backup method.<br>
<br>
There were a few bugs, but overall the app has a nice look.  Message delivery was not 100% reliable but there is an option to resend messages.  Since this is only on iOS this limits who will be able to use it.<br>
<br>
Overall I think the technology and security is good, I am just not convinced that this blockchain feature really adds much and being available only on one platform is a negative for me.<br>
