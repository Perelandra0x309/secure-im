TwinMe is easy to setup and to connect with another TwinMe user, you can either scan their QR code in person or send them an invite link.<br>
This app is truly peer to peer, so sometime when you try to send a message it will just appear with a spinning circle next to it.  This just means that the other person is not online.  You can close the app and it will work in the background and deliver the message once the other person is online.<br>
The interface is professional looking, though the iOS version seems more consistant with the host OS than the Android version.<br>
One cool feature is the ability to stream music from your device to your contact's device.<br>
On Android Google Play Services are not required.  The Android version I first tried from the Amazon app store would not launch at all. 
The version from the Google Play Store (downloaded via Yalp) did run.<br>
On Copperhead, the battery optimization settings need to be set to Off for TwinMe to stay connected when in the background.<br>
Added in version 8.3.0 is the ability to delete messages you have sent from both your device and the device of your chat partner.  Simply swipe the text to the left and the delete icon will appear.<br>

My Verdict: One of the best peer to peer chat apps!<br>
<br>
This app is very reliable and easy to use.  It has a unique feature with its music streaming ability.  I wish it had quoting of messages, ephemeral messages and contact verification.  Not having a server in the middle handling messages makes this a very safe app to use.<br>
The FAQ mentions that you can preserve your ID and contacts when changing to a new device by doing a full backup with iTunes or your PC, so just be conscious of having that information in any backups you may do.<br>
With both iOS and Android apps this can be used by a majority of phone users.<br>
