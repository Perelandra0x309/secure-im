 Pros:<br>
   On F-Droid<br>
   Not dependent on Google play services<br>
 Cons:<br>
   People have to know your phone#<br>
   Android only<br>
<br>
Android leaks files: found photos in Local Storage/Device Storage/Pictures/Kontalk.  This is a known issue but may not get resolved: <a href="https://github.com/kontalk/androidclient/issues/951">Encrypt local media #951</a><br>
<br>
Multiple devices are supported, go to the settings on an existing device and use the Maintenance->Register Device option.<br>
<br>
My verdict: So close!<br>
I really like the concept of using XMPP protocol but with a client that can only communicate with the same client, so that you are sure your communication partner is also using a secure client app.  However Kontalk unfortunately leaks data, so both sides are not totally secure.  Also your phone number is how people add you as a contact so that compromises your privacy if you don't want people to know your phone number.<br>
