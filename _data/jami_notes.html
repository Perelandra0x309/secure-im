Pros:<br>
On F-Droid<br>
Multiple platforms<br>
Not dependent on a phone #<br>
Cons:<br>
Android and Mac app still have some usability issues, just out of beta.  The Mac app saves images you receive into your Documents folder, no option to disable this.<br>
<br>
Encryption:<br>
Uses the GnuTLS library with RSA keys and X.509 certificates.<br>
<br>
My verdict: Pass<br>
This is being developed as a side project by Savoir-faire Linux so they know open source!  The clients have a unified experience and are available for most platforms.<br>
This was designed as a P2P app, so messages you send out are not synced between your multiple clients if you have them running simultaneously.  However messages sent to you do appear on all your clients, making a somewhat confusing stream of conversation when using multiple clients.<br>
The primary purpose of Jami is for video calling, but messaging (to individuals) does somewhat work.  Several times during testing messages failed to be delivered even in the middle of a conversation.  While the Android client does not appear to leak files (none that I could find) the Mac version saves files sent to you right in your Documents folder. This makes this app insecure for anyone using the Mac version or send to someone else who is.<br>
