Silence is an SMS application that adds the ability to send encrypted messages over SMS.  It also saves your text SMS message in an encrypted database on the phone.<br>

It looks like there haven't bee any code updates for over a year now.  So if this is no longer maintained that is a concern.<br>
Gitlab source repository moved to their own instance in 2019: <a href="https://silence.im/contribute/">https://silence.im/contribute/</a><br>
Last merge was in 2020: <a href="https://git.silence.dev/Silence/Silence-Android/-/merge_requests?scope=all&utf8=%E2%9C%93&state=all">here</a><br>
<br>
My Verdict:<br>
As a plain SMS app this at least encrypts the local database.  But this appears not to be maintained anymore and now there are so many excellent alternatives that encrypt both message contents and meta data.
