Silence is an SMS application that adds the ability to send encrypted messages over SMS.  It also saves your text SMS message in an encrypted database on the phone.<br>

My Verdict:<br>
This is an excellent replacement SMS application.  If you don't want the extra features of Signal this is a great choice.
