<p>TwinMe uses proven TLS encryption to make a direct Peer to Peer connection between devices.  The only server involved is a signaling server that helps devices find each other to be able to connect.  Messages are sent direct from device to device without going though a server.</p>
<p>There is no information needed to signup, you don't have any account at all just an ID on your device that is randomly generated.  Connecting with others is accomplished by sharing your device ID.  This means though that if you do change devices your old ID will no longer work and any contacts you have made you will need to send the ID of your new device and reconnect with them.</p>
