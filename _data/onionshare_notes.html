OnionShare is a desktop application that offers an easy way to create servers for hosting websites, file sharing, file drop and chatting.  All servers are accessible through a Tor .onion address so inherit all the security and privacy features of the Tor network.<br />
<br />
The chat features are fairly basic at this time.  It is text only and there are no notifications when new messages arrive.  You also must have an active connection to the server to receive messages.  If you are offline any messages sent to the server do not get delivered to you.  As a consequence there is no history of saved messages that can be retrieved while you were offline.<br>
<br />
The OnionShare application creates the server part of the chat system.  This is very easy to do, you do not need to have any server administration experience or do any complicated systems setup.  Just run the OnionShare application, choose a few settings and start the server on your own home computer.  The server will have a .onion URL that you can send to anyone you want to connect to the chat server.  To send and receive messages the "client" part of the chat system is actually the Tor Browser.  Paste the .onion URL into the Tor Browser address bar and you are now connected to the chat server as a new user.  There is no need to register accounts on the system, if you have the URL you can just connect to it.  When first connected you are given a random name, which can be changed.  By using the Tor browser this also makes it very easy for anyone to join the chat (as long as they have the URL) and the only requirement is to have the Tor Browser installed.<br />
<br />
The Tor Browser on Android does also work as a client, however at the time of this review the interface is still scaled the same as when using the desktop Tor Browser, so the text is very small.  But it is still usable.  Also on Android when switching to another application the connection between Tor Browser and the OnionShare chat server is stopped, so if any messages are sent when you are not actively in Tor Browser these messages will not appear when you return to the Tor Browser.  The desktop Tor Browsers do keep an active connection even when using other applications so as long as the tab is not closed you can receive messages from OnionShare while using other applications on a desktop.<br />
<br />
No messages are stored anywhere to disk on either the server or client sides.  You send a message to the server, and the server immmediately sends out that message only to those clients with an active connection.  There is no history saved anywhere.  The clients are really just a tab in the Tor Browser, so as soon as that tab is closed all the data and messages from the chat session are gone.  These messages are therefore ephemeral as they are destroyed as soon as the clients are closed.<br />
<br />
Because you must have an active connection to send/receive messages I see this chat system is best when used for short communcations when you really need privacy and ephemeral messages.  You can quickly create a new chat server if you are communicating on another platform but feel the need for more privacy and security.  This isn't really a system you would leave up running all the time.  There are no notifications (yet) so you must manually check the Tor Browser tab for any new messages.  Also if someone goes offline there is no way to queue a message for them to receive when they return.  So this is really a system for when all parties in a conversation can be actively online at the same time.<br />
<br />
The only other real downside to this system I can find is that there really isn't any type of contact verification.  When someone connects they can put in any name for themselves that they want.  So having a second scure channel of communication is important to send the URL to the chat server and verify that the person you wanted to connect is truely the one connected (verify the name they used).<br />
<br />
<br>
My verdict: Excellent option when you want a private ad-hoc conversation<br>
All participants must be actively online since all messages are transferred in real time without any queues.  The server is very easy to setup (and take down) on a regular desktop PC, and the Tor Browser is the only requirement needed to connect to the server.  All messages are destroyed as soon as the Tor Browser tab for the chat is closed.
