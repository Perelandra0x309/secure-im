<br>
Session (previously called Loki) is still in beta but so far I am very impressed with the functionality and features of this app.  It runs on top of a distributed network of servers that run the Loki Network.<br>
<br>
I like very much that the encryption uses the Signal protocol, which is very good.  The Signal app is designed to use a centralized server infrastructure, however this messenger uses the Signal protocol on top of the decentralized Loki network. This decentralization greatly improve the anonymity and robustness of the system.<br>
<br>
Features I like:
<ul>
<li>Disappearing message can be set from 5 seconds to 1 week</li>
<li>You can manually reset the session keys</li>
<li>Read link previews, read receipts and typing indicators can be turned on or off</li>
<li>The use of FCM (Google Firebase) for notifications can be turned on or off</li>
</ul>
<br>
The feature set of the mobile apps is slightly behind the desktop apps.<br>
<br>
My verdict: I am loving it!<br>
<br>
I will wait a while and see how this app develops, but I am already loving this.  It has all the privacy features needed and runs on top of a decentralized network.  The speed is very fast, and the desktop client (MacOS) is very feature complete.  This is very early in the development still, but it has great promise.  This is one app to keep around to test and see how it develops.
