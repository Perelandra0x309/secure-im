Decentralized messaging and sharing app built on top of Secure Scuttlebutt<br>
<br>
My verdict: Great option for desktops, mobiles coming soon?<br>
Private messages are end-to-end encrypted, always.<br>
You have to follow somebody to get messages from them, so you won't get spammed.<br>
The datastructure is a global mesh of append-only logs, which can support new types of data (not just "mail").<br>
Users are not bound to one server/host (what we call "Pubs") and do not have to trust the servers.<br>
