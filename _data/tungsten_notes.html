May 2020- Well it looks like Tunsgten is dead, no recent updates with the app or in their social media channels.  The app won't connect anymore. It was a great concept, just maybe it couldn't make enough money to survive.<br />
9/29/19- Version 1.6.2 Tungsten now costs US $8.99 in the Google or Apple store, or the older free version is still available as an Android apk download on their website.<br>
3/10/18- Version 0.5.0 Update: Google Play service no longer required, notifications available for anonymous personas.<br>
<br>
Tungsten is a messenger that connects over the Tor network.  You can send images and files in the chat sessions.<br>
The company is based in Germany but their servers will be located in Iceland when the app is closer to a final release.<br>
If you add Tungsten to another device you do not get previous chat history but you do get all your contacts.  Once you do connect a device all subsequent messages are synced to all devices.<br>
You can create a public persona which is tied to your phone number.  Or you can create an anonymous persona which is not linked to any personal information. You can be logged in with multiple personas.<br>
<br>
My verdict:<br>
I like this app a lot, it is definitely worth a try and worth keeping an eye on for future updates and improvements.  Using Tor built into the app is a definite plus since you don't need a separate Tor connection application.  The content options in chats are limited but hopefully those will expand in future releases.<br>
