3/10/18- Version 0.5.0 Update: Google Play service no longer required, notifications available for anonymous personas.<br>
<br>
Tungsten is a new messenger in beta that connects over the Tor network.  So far you can only send images and files in the chat sessions.<br>
On Android without Google Play services other people will see you as offline.  Also notifications are not working.<br>
The company is based in Germany but their servers will be located in Iceland when the app is closer to a final release.<br>
If you add Tungsten to another device you do not get previous chat history but you do get all your contacts.  Once you do connect a device all subsequent messages are synced to all devices.<br>
You can create a public persona which is tied to your phone number.  Or you can create an anonymous persona which is not linked to any personal information. You can be logged in with multiple personas.<br>
<br>
My verdict:<br>
I like this app a lot even as a beta release, it is definitely worth a try and worth keeping an eye on for future updates and improvements.  Using Tor built into the app is a definite plus since you don't need a separate Tor connection application.  The content options in chats are limited but hopefully those will expand in future releases.<br>
