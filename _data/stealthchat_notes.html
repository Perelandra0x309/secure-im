Self destruct messages<br>
Requires a phone number to register, uses the phone numbers in your contacts list to search for others, exposes your phone number to others.<br>
Available on the Amazon app store, but it is an older version.<br>
During testing there were several delays in messages being delivered, and some messages not burning.<br>
<br>
Encryption:<br>
StealthChat uses OTR encryption which has limitations to single device to device communication.<br>
<br>
My verdict:<br>
Among the P2P applications this one is basic and has some reliability issues.  There are other P2P apps that have better features and do not expose your phone number, so I do not recommend this one<br>
