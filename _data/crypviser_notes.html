Crypviser is unique messaging application that uses a public blockchain to store half of the public key of all users.  This is claimed to prevent man in the middle attacks because the integrity of the public key can be verified against the blockchain.<br>
<br>
Each chat can be password protected or hidden with a password.  Individual messages or the entire chat can be deleted on both sides.  The application interface is nicely done and is easy to navigate.  The are Crypvisor tokens (CVT) that you can send to others within the applications.<br>
<br>
During testing there was a message that appeared to be sent, but it was never received.  Several times the application crashed (Android version).  Sometimes messages that were set to expire had the timer stop, and so were ever deleted after the timeout period.  I was not able to successfully set a profile folder, after choosing a photo to use the avatar just never changed from the generic person graphic.<br>
<br>
The use of blockchain is a good effort to try to ensure integrity of a public key. The first half of the key is stored iin publicly accessible blockchain, the other half is stored on the CV servers. This forces the clients to use the CV server for ID validation and acquiring half of the public key needed to encrypt messages. While the ID verification using the CV server is nice, it would still be good to have contact verification via some key fingerprint as a manual verification.<br>
<br>
From the whitepaper:<br>
<blockquote>
The next generation of Crypviser 2.0 will be based on the new kind of Blockchain especially designed for
the reliable encryption keys exchange and authentication purposes in instant communication networks.
Crypviser Blockchain will be represented as a first mobile Blockchain, where <u>every device will operate as a
node to serve transactions of encryption keys exchange and validation</u>.

<br>
My verdict: Interesting, too many bugs<br>
<br>
There were several bugs, but overall the app has a nice look.  Message delivery was not 100% reliable and the Android app crashed several times. Some expiring messages failed to delete after the set timeout period.<br>
<br>
The use of blockchain is unique, however only half of the public key is stored in blockchain. This means you are still dependent on and must trust the CV server to provide user identification verification and the second half of the public key. This may be changing with the 2.0 version of the blockchain (see the whitepaper).
