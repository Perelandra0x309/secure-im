This app requires access to your Contacts to work, without access it will not function at all.<br>
<br>
The first registration attempt failed, however once I did get it registered messages seemed to be sent and received quickly.  This is probably due to the peer to peer design.<br>
<br>
Your phone number is required to register, and is used by others to search for you in the app. In effect your ID is directly linked to your phone number.<br>

Unencrypted files were found in public storage on Android in the directories &quot;/pinngle/.temp&quot; and &quot;/pinngle/Pinngle Files&quot;.  There are also other folders that were empty but if they were already created they would probably be used at some point for various types of data.  Some of the directory names are &quot;.audiorecord&quot;, &quot;.groupchat&quot;, &quot;.stickers&quot;, &quot;.profilepicture&quot;, and &quot;.linktumb&quot;.<br>
<br>
I was not able to find any whitepaper or any specific details about the design of the application or the encryption protocols used. The website only mentions that it is a &quot;serverless architecture&quot;.<br>
<br>
My verdict: Not enough details<br>
<br>
I really don't know how the program works, and the saving of data unencrypted in public storage is a big concern.  There are better applications available.<br>
