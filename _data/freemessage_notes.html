This app requires a phone number to sign in and uses your contacts' phone numbers to connect to other users.<br>
All photos, videos, gifs were sent and received without any issues.  It also has "Real Emotions" that are animated backgrounds with custom text you can send.<br>
Overall this is a solid and good looking chat application.  Notifications on Android actually work (unlike some other apps).<br>
Perfect forward secrecy used in transport layer only.<br>
<br>
My verdict:<br>
For communicating with those you don't mind having your phone number this app is perfectly functional and simple to use yet still provides end to end encryption and encrypted local storage.<br>
