Servers based in Switzerland are only used as temporary location for messages until they are delivered to the recipient. Minimal meta data is known.<br>
Registration requires an email address which is used as your account ID which other people must search for.  I would like to see this changed so your email is hidden and you can search for others by their display name.<br>
Fairly basic messenger app, and last update was in March 2017 for Android so I am not sure how much this is being worked on.  The forum has very infrequent posts and there were no blog posts on the website dedicated to this app.<br>
Multi device sync does seem to work with Android and the web app.  How do they accomplish that?<br>
Update: December 2017: Golden Frog has no plans to provide further updates, so any improvements I would like to see do not look like they will happen.  As it is now, since your email address is your ID I do not consider this a secure application.<br>
<br>
My Verdict:<br>
Without any further updates this application is only useful to communicate with anyone you trust to know your email address.
