Connecting with another user took a couple tries (and two new accounts) to finally succeed, and after leaving the app and getting back in I was never able to successfully log in again, I just get a spinning circle of death.  The app seems to be locked into using only xmpp accounts on their own xrooters.ro server.<br>
They say it can use Tor but I don't see anywhere that indicates whether Tor is being used or not, and there are no settings in the app.<br>
<br>
My verdict: There are better options<br>
I appreciate that the app is open sourced. However there is almost zero documentation on the website about the features of this app. It is nice to see this effort to make encryption with xmpp the default, and also the use of Tor.  The app just needs more work to make it usable, you can't do much if just logging in not working.<br>
