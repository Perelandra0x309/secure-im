This is a very nice multi-device application that will sync your content across all devices.  There are several tiers of features for use by individuals, teams or enterprises.  The individual free tier is very nice, unfortunately it is missing locally encrypted database and sent message editing.  The $5.99/month package adds these features.<br>
Also included are online saving of notes, passwords, files and a calendar.<br>
Transferring to another Android device: just download the app and login with your account username, password and secret phrase.<br>
Android leaks files: found photos in Local Storage/Device Storage/Android/data/com.vipole.client/cache<br>
<br>
My verdict:<br>
This is a nice application, but you must pay a monthly fee to get local encryption at rest and deletion of messages.<br>
