This is a very nice multi-device application that will sync your content across all devices.  There are several tiers of features for use by individuals, teams or enterprises.  The individual free tier is very nice, unfortunately it is missing locally encrypted database and sent message editing.  The $5.99/month package adds these features.<br>
Also included are online saving of notes, passwords, files and a calendar.
