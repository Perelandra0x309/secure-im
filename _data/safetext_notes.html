On Android new text messages are not displayed unless you exit the conversation then reenter it, even though on the other device it says the message has been read.<br>
<br>
On Android there is a folder /device/SafeText/Images.  While nothing appeared to be saved in this folder even after sending and receiving messages, it is concerning that this folder even exists.  What is the purpose, will this ever be used?  Will photos ever be leaked into this folder?<br>
<br>
One nice feature is all chats automatically expire in 24 hours (or less if you set the expiration lower in settings). You can also delete any single message or the entire chat from both devices.<br>
<br>
There is not much information on the website about how the application actually works, or which countries the servers are located in (the website just says outside of the USA in privacy friendly nations).  However it is apparent that messages are saved on the server (until they expire) since I am able to log into the website portal and see all messages that were previously sent.  Syncing between devices works very instantly and consistently.<br>
<br>
To change devices simply download the app and login with your account credentials.<br>
<br>
My verdict: Nice anonymity<br>
<br>
I like that no personal information is required, and access to your contacts is optional.  Messages also automatically expire in 24 hours or less.<br>

There is a bug preventing messages from showing on Android, and there was a folder of concern I found but it did not appear to be used.  Also legal jurisdiction (Cayman Islands is a territory of the UK) puts it very close to 5 eyes authorities.  There is also very little documented technical information on the system architecture.
