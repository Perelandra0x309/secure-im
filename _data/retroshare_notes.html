<br>
What is leaked to the world when using the DHT.<br>
- Your IP address.<br>
- The IP addresses that you are connecting to.<br>
Optionally, Retroshare may be configured to tunnel through I2P or Tor
with friend finding turned off to function as a true darknet. This
however, is slow, unreliable, high-latency, and very difficult to set up.<br>
<br>
- Retroshare may appear to use PGP, but what actually seems to be
happening under the hood is that it's using the RSA keys to sign
ephemeral keys which are then used to establish connections to your
friends via perfect forward secrecy. The PGP parts of it look like they
are used only for certifying and authentication, and are not used to
encrypt the data.<br>
<br>
- Certificate authorities are not used, the networks are fully
friend-to-friend. This is markedly different from peer-to-peer because
it is expected in a friend-to-friend network, you already know, and
already trust the people you will be connecting and routing for. This is
a VERY important distinction in the differences between peer-to-peer and
friend to friend.<br>
<br>
- Key signing or setting up a PGP web of trust model is in some cases
mandatory.<br>
<br>
- Retroshare is difficult to set up for the average user. Every user on
the Retroshare network MUST know how to port forward or the friend
lookup will not function.<br>
<br>
- Because it is assumed you already trust the people that you will be
using retroshare to connect to, Retroshare makes no effort to disguise
or hide your IP address from them. In fact, if your IP address changes,
they will get a warning message.<br>

- When operating through the regular Internet, it looks like Retroshare
uses a Distributed Hash Table for IP address lookups and friend finding.
If this is correct this may present a source of metadata leakage. I will
need to look into this some more and find out how it works, because I
don't want to spread F-U-D.<br>
<br>
- Retroshare *can be made to* go over I2P, but doing so is very slow and
requires configuration of the I2P Router. You will need to set up your
own tunnels. The documentation for this is a little bit sparse and some
of it is in Spanish. You may need to do a bit of experimentation before
it works. During this time on I2P, friend finding and the DHT can be
turned off, and in this case, Retroshare will function as a true Darknet
which will allow for TLS-secured traffic to be wrapped up within I2P's
native encryption functions. But this is extremely slow and difficult.<br>
<br>
- Retroshare is loaded with features and probably hands down has the
most features of any instant messaging bundle. It is VERY good at
distributing large files among friends who trust each other.<br>
<br>
- Retroshare's trust model is transitory. Friends-of-friends have a
certain amount of privilege in some areas. For the rest, a lot of it
uses the PGP web of trust.<br>
<br>
- The code base has not recently been audited (if ever?). This is the
same situation with I2P, where the weak link might be the client
software and not the protocol.<br>
<br>
- If your Retroshare private key is stolen, although technically you
have perfect forward secrecy with TLS, the problem with Retroshare tends
to be that much of the content on the network is distributed among your
friends. It can be difficult to take back down once. So, for instance,
let us say that Alice, Bob, Charlie and Daniel start posting on a
Retroshare messageboard that is private to them. Sometime later, Mallory
steals Alice's plaintext private key. Even if she does not have Alice's
computer, she can still impersonate Alice to Bob, Charlie and Daniel,
and re-synchronize her 'copy' of the messageboard with theirs and see
all of their would-be private communications. If Alice sent movie.mov to
Charlie, and Charlie sent it to Bob, even if Charlie moved movie.mov
out of his share, Mallory can use Alice's private key to impersonate
Alice and re-download movie.mov from Bob instead.<br>
<br>
- The more friends you have on your Retroshare network, the more routing
your computer must do and the more bandwidth and processing power the
program will need to function comfortably.<br>
<br>
- There is a commandline version of Retroshare that is intended to be
used as a retroshare server. I have never used it, so I cannot comment
on it.
