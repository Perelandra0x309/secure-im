First a quick note of clarification- Messages in this app are <strong>not</strong> stored on the blockchain.  Only the underlying server infrastructure uses blockchain, so rest assured your messages (even encrypted) are not stored indefinitely in blockchain.<br>
<br>
BCM is a fairly recently developed messenger that claims to be "By Hackers For Hackers".  I am excited to watch this application develop as it seems to have so many excellent characteristings, including use of the Signal protocol, anonymous IDs, decentralization, ephemeral messages, perfect forward secrecy, etc.  While using the app I did not find any leakage of data into public storage on Android where other apps could access data.  The messages have all the basic features you need such as sending photos, links, audio, location, contacts, replies and group chats.<br>
<br>
I did have trouble sending images a couple times.  They would attempt to send but then fail.  Retrying to send the same photo a bit later then succeeded.<br>
<br>
You can export your identity key and move the app to another device.  However all previous messages will be lost and contacts will not transfer over.  You do see the groups you were a member of on the new device but again no message history.<br>
<br>
My Verdict: Definitely one to try out and watch<br>
<br>
This messenger ticks all the right boxes: strong encryption with a tested protocol, ephemeral messages, decentralized infrastructure, anonymous signup, iOS and Android support, it does not leak data.  It has some rough spots but that is to be expected from a very new app.  I am keeping an eye on this one.<br>
My wish list to add to this app:
<ul>
<li>Desktop PC support</li>
<li>Use on multiple devices</li>
</ul>
