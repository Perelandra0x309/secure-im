This app is more focused on encrypted file sharing but it does have a secure messaging section.  The features of the messaging were fairly standard.  It does have a "Timed Delete" feature that is supposed to delete the message after the given time has expired but in testing we did have one message that did not delete.<br>

To search for other get2clouds users you must grant access to the phone's contact list.  Searching will not work without that access.<br>
<br>
Despite there being some articles on their blog regarding Facebook data and profile gathering, this app has 4 Facebook trackers in it. Hmm.<br>
<br>
While I did find user avatars stored in public file storage on Android at /get2clouds I did not find any other files or photos that were sent in messages.<br>
<br>
My verdict: No thanks, Facebook tracking.<br>
<br>
I am concerned about the access required for your phone's contacts list, but then add the Faceook trackers to it and this is a definate no!
