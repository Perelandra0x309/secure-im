When you first open that app there is nothing to add for contact info, an accont is automatically created for you and you are assigned a an identifying number.<br>
<br>
When trying this application on Android I was not able to even make a good connection to the server, with an error of "Unauthorized" even though the account creation process seemed to be automatic.  Despite not having a good login connection, it allowed me to add another contact of the account on my iPhone, which was able to log in.  However when trying to send a message on the Android the message status remained stuck at "encrypting..." and never was sent.<br>
<br>
After I took a photo to send on the Android device I found a copy of the phooto unencrypted under /Android/data/net.kryptotel.chat/files/Pictures<br>
<br>
My verdict: Not secure<br>
<br>
I would not recommend this app since the Android version does not seem to work at all and it leaks files.<br>
