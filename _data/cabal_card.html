<p>Cabal is a new messenger which is built on top of the <a href="https://dat.foundation">Dat</a> protocol which uses symmetric keys to validate data and provide access to encrypted dat files.  You create a Cabal which is essentially an encrypted database which is replicated with anyone you provide the public key to.  This is a very early project so it is yet to be seen what the final security of the system will be, so do not use this for anything truly private.</p>
