Update in 2020: Keybase was <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/7/21250418/zoom-keybase-acquisition-encryption-security-messages-services">sold to Zoom</a>.  The purchase was a talent acquisition, so it was the people and skills that Zoom wanted to get from the Keybase team to help Zoom imrove their encryption and security of the platform.  Whether Keybase will continue is not known, but there is little chance for there to be very much work done on it for improvements or bug fixes going forward.  So this is an unfortunate turn for this app and with the unknown future of the platform I would not recommend investing very much time into it if you are not already signed up.<br>

You can also verify other website identities, GPG keys, domains, etc that you own.<br>
<br>
Keybase <a href="https://keybase.io/blog/keybase-exploding-messages">adds "exploding" messages</a> (ephemeral). Note these messages do use perfect forward secrecy, however regular non-ephemeral messages do not.<br>
<br>
My verdict: Great for chat and other uses, but uncertain future<br>
Keybase has several unique features, which now also includes secured personal and group file storage and sharing and encrypted git.  It is also very easy for someone new to PGP to create a new key for themselves.
