<p>Snikket is a project that is trying to make using XMPP as easy as possible and providing a more unified and consistant experience across platforms.  So far they have an XMPP server based on Prosody, an Android client based on Conversations and an iOS client based on Siskin.  The clients and server are designed to work together, though they can be used with non-Snikket systems.  The server is very easy to setup on your own host and all features and plugins are already enabled by default.</p>
<p>Snikket uses the OMEMO protocol to encrypt messages.  There is some more meta data saved on the servers other messengers, but that can be mitigated by self hosting your own Snikket server.</p>

<br>
Pros:
<ul>
<li>If you self host you control all the information on your own server</li>
<li>Communicate in one on one and group text chats</li>
<li>There are many XMPP servers to choose from if you don't want to host your own</li>
<li>If you self host or choose a good server you do not have to provide email or other identifying information</li>
<li>Snikket provides an easy way for new users to signup using invitations</li>
<li>Messages are preserved if you move to another device or use multiple devices with the same account</li>
<li>Consistant features across Android and iOS</li>
</ul>
Cons:
<ul>
<li>More meta data is saved on the servers than some messengers (which is why self-hosting is recommended)</li>

<li>No ephemeral messages</li>
</ul>
Other features:
<ul>
<li>Use the same account on multiple devices</li>
