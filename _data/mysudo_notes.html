MySudo is an application that gives you a phone number (US or Canada) for calls or SMS and an email address.  The phone number works just like your cell phone number but works over wifi. This is a really easy way to give yourself a second number to provide to any person or company you don't want to give your real number to.  Or you can subscribe to a monthly plan and get multiple numbers and assign each number a role to seperate uses for each number.  It is up to you to decide what the purpose of each number is.<br>
So the end to end message encryption covers only other MySudo users you connect with. Anyone else uses regular SMS messages. So as a secure messaging platform, it is very similar to Signal, except that you are using what is essentially a VoIP phone number.  However unless there is a large uptake in MySudo users, you may not have many opportunities to use E2EE messaging.<br>
Currently is it for iOS only, however that may change inthe future.<br>

My verdict: Great if you want a second phone number!<br>
The main purpose of this app is to provide you with a second phone number that you can use instead of your primary cell phone number.  The added functionality of E2EE (limited only to other iOS MySudo users) is really just a bonus. This will not replace you current messaging app anytime soon.  There is nothing wrong with the app, it works very well for its intended purpose, which does not happen to be to take over the messaging universe.<br>
