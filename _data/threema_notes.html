Threema is very easy to setup and use.  Linking to an email or phone number is totally optional. 
To add a contact you need to acquire their Threema ID via a separate channel, search your contacts list for a match,
 or scan their fingerprint QR code in person.  These three methods attach 3 levels of "verification" 
to your contacts:
<ul>
<li>Red- Anonymous (added manually)</li>
<li>Yellow- Matches a contact in your address book</li>
<li>Green- QR code scanned in person</li>
</ul>
This is a nice feature so you can have and easily see different trust levels of your contacts.<br>
It is also very easy to create encrypted group chats with multiple contacts.  All individual and 
group chats will show up in the same list.<br>

From the <a href="https://threema.ch/en/faq">FAQ</a>:
<blockquote cite="https://threema.ch/en/faq">
Which data gets stored at Threema?<br>
<br>
Using Threema ought to generate as little data on servers as possible â€“ this is part of the concept.
For that reason, data like e.g. contacts or group chats are stored in a decentralized way on user
devices, instead of on a Threema server. Our servers assume the role of a switch; messages and data
get forwarded, but not permanently stored. Where there is no data, there is nothing to be accessed
or misused. However: without some kind of (temporary) data storage, there cannot be any asynchronous
communication. In the following we will explain what kind of data we store, how we store it and for
how long.<br>
<br>
Messages and group chats: As soon as a message has been successfully delivered to the recipient, it
is immediately deleted from the server. All messages and media are transmitted end-to-end encrypted
in Threema. This means: even if someone intercepted your message, it would be completely useless.
Only the intended recipient is able to decrypt and read a message.<br>
No contact lists are stored when synchronizing contacts: The email addresses and phone numbers from
your address book get anonymized (hashed) before they reach the server. Once the comparison is
finished, they are immediately deleted from the server.<br>
Key pairs are generated in a decentralized way on your device. Your private key is never known to
us, and therefore we cannot decrypt any message contents.<br>
Threema doesn't log who is communicating with whom (which Threema IDs are communicating).

Encryption process (from the whitepaper):<br>
<img src="images/threema_encryption.png"><br>
This process uses the <a href="https://nacl.cr.yp.to/box.html">Box model</a> of the NaCl cryptography library.<br>
A shared secret is generated using both the private key of one chat participant and the public key of the other participant.  So both participants are able to generate the same shared secret without the need for any negotiations over the internet or transmitting any information at all, except for initially acquiring the other participant's public key. This also has the advantage of being able to generate the secret while the other participant is offline. This shared secret cannot change, unless one of the participants changes their Threema ID (and thus their key pair).<br>
Each message has a random nonce generated for it, this acts as a salt value, and is combined with the shared secret to encrypt the message. This does not provide perfect forward secrecy, but it does insert an element of randomness so that analysis of Threema encrypted messages is made more difficult than a series of messages encrypted with Public Key Infrastructure methods that use the same symmetric key for every message.<br>
For group chats when a message is send the message is encrypted separately for every member of the group using the same method as a one to one chat.  So if there are 12 participants in a group, a message will be encrypted 11 times, once for each of the other group members, and each message will have a different nonce.<br>

This looks interesting- an open source implimentation of the Threema client (not official): <a href="https://openmittsu.de/">openMittsu</a><br>
<br>
My Verdict: Almost perfect<br>
<br>
Truly this is an app that provides almost a perfect secured messaging system.  Limited meta data, very easy to use, foolproof encryption.  The only features missing are perfect forward secrecy on message encryption (data in transit is additionally encrypted with TLS) and ephemeral messages.  Oh and being able to use it on multiple devices would be nice as well.  But the simplicity of use and low cost are what make this app a top choice for me.
