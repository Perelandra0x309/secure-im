Threema is very easy to setup and use.  Linking to an email or phone number is totally optional. 
To add a contact you need to acquire their Threema ID via a separate channel, search your contacts list for a match,
 or scan their fingerprint QR code in person.  These three methods attach 3 levels of "verification" 
to your contacts:
<ul>
<li>Red- Anonymous (added manually)</li>
<li>Yellow- Matches a contact in your address book</li>
<li>Green- QR code scanned in person</li>
</ul>
This is a nice feature so you can have and easily see different trust levels of your contacts.<br>
It is also very easy to create encrypted group chats with multiple contacts.  All individual and 
group chats will show up in the same list.<br>

Which data gets stored at Threema?<br>
<br>
Using Threema ought to generate as little data on servers as possible â€“ this is part of the concept.
For that reason, data like e.g. contacts or group chats are stored in a decentralized way on user
devices, instead of on a Threema server. Our servers assume the role of a switch; messages and data
get forwarded, but not permanently stored. Where there is no data, there is nothing to be accessed
or misused. However: without some kind of (temporary) data storage, there cannot be any asynchronous
communication. In the following we will explain what kind of data we store, how we store it and for
how long.<br>
<br>
Messages and group chats: As soon as a message has been successfully delivered to the recipient, it
is immediately deleted from the server. All messages and media are transmitted end-to-end encrypted
in Threema. This means: even if someone intercepted your message, it would be completely useless.
Only the intended recipient is able to decrypt and read a message.<br>
No contact lists are stored when synchronizing contacts: The email addresses and phone numbers from
your address book get anonymized (hashed) before they reach the server. Once the comparison is
finished, they are immediately deleted from the server.<br>
Key pairs are generated in a decentralized way on your device. Your private key is never known to
us, and therefore we cannot decrypt any message contents.<br>
Threema doesn't log who is communicating with whom (which Threema IDs are communicating).
