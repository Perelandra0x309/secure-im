When first setting up the app on Android, after signup I kept getting an error about no connection being available.  I was able to sign in using an iPhone, then later was able to successfully login with the Android device.  On Android contacts' avatars do not display, but they do on iPhone.<br>
<br>
I know this is a P2P app but I was able to login with both an Android and iPhone at the same time and participate in a chat. Some messages were not received on my Android device but they were received on my iPhone.<br>
<br>
Photos were found unencrypted in public storage on Android, in device/com.btdstudio.linkcast/Param<br>

If you log out or restart your device, you must first put in your phone number to receive a 2FA code to input into the app.  Then you must provide your PIN to login.  While this security feature is good, it would be appreciated if one of those could be turned off in settings.  However I think the PIN is used for encrypting the local database, so probably the only option would be to have the 2FA feature on/off.<br>

The website has many misspelled or obviously missing words on the website, especially on the FAQ page.<br>
<br>
Encryption:<br>
Key pairs are negotiated using Curve25519 with Diffie-Hellman, and a shared secret is derived.  Data is then encrypted using AES 256.  Message authentication is ensured using HMAC-SHA512.<br>
<br>
My verdict: Too many problems with Android<br>
<br>
While the iOS app works very well, the Android app has a few bugs and also leaks data.  While it is meant as a P2P app you can log in with multiple devices and that may be the reason for messages not being properly synced between devices.<br>
<br>
The Android app also does not display avatars, and photos are saved unencrypted in public storage.  If it weren't for this unfortunate security issue I would have given this app a &quot;Worth a try&quot; rating.<br>
<br>
While it does require a phone number to sign up and log in, this number is not shown to other users so your privacy is protected.<br>
