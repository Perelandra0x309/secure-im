Note: On 11/24/2018 I noticed this app is no longer available in the iOS or Android app store.<br>
<br>
Unique features:<br>
<ul>
<li>Messages are only stored for up to 30 days on the server while attempting to be delivered.  After 30 days the undelivered message is deleted.</li>
<li>Messages are not stored on the device, they are gone once they have been read.</li>
<li>Text messages are limited to 100 characters.</li>
</ul>
You get a notification if a chat partner takes a screenshot on their device.  Though on Android I was not able to take a screenshot of messages (it said that was not allowed by policy) but could take screenshots of other parts of the program.<br>
No quoting of previous messages is available, so longer conversations are a bit difficult.  Also in long conversations you will be typing and sending a message, going back to the main menu, waiting for a response, then going into your inbox to retrieve the message.  At least there is a "Reply" button right in the current message, but there is still a lot of moving back and forth between screens unlike most apps where all conversation is held in one place.<br>
Sometimes I could not receive a picture when sent from iOS to Android.  The other way worked fine, and recorded audio clips worked just fine being sent both directions.<br>
I was able to install the app on another device and log in to communicate with the same Squealock ID I had created on the first device.<br>
<br>
My verdict: Good for short messages, if you don't want any traces left on your phone.<br>
<br>
This app does very well at keeping your communications private.  As soon as you read a message it is destroyed so there is no trace of it on your device.  The only trace your message will have is when the message is in the process of being delivered it resides on their server (encrypted of course).  Messages that have not been delivered within 30 days are deleted from the server.<br>
Messages are received in an "inbox", and each message shows up individually.  Having a conversation is challenging since messages immediately disappear and their is no way to quote previous messages.  This plus the 100 character limitation on message length make this good for short messages and brief conversations only.<br>
There were a couple bugs, notably sending pictures from iOS to Android did not always work (but no problems the other way).<br>
