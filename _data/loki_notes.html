Loki is still in beta but so far I am very impressed with the functionality and features of this app.  It runs on top of a distributed network of servers that run the Loki Network.<br>
<br>
I like very much that the encryption uses the Tox protocol, which is very good.  Unfortunately most messaging clients that use Tox are of inferior quality which is why I normally do not recommend Tox based apps.  However this messenger uses Tox on top of the Loki network, and you can only connect with other Loki Messenger users so you don't have to be concerned about someone on the other side of your conversations using an insecure client.<br>
<br>
Features I like:
<ul>
<li>Disappearing message can be set from 5 seconds to 1 week</li>
<li>You can manually reset the session keys</li>
<li>Read receipts and typing indicators can be turned on or off</li>
<li>You can set your own desired "Time to live" for messages. This is how long messages will remain on the Loki network waiting for the recipient to log in.  If they haven't logged in by the expiration of the timer then the messages is deleted.  The options for the timeout are from 12 hours to 96 hours.</li>
</ul>
<br>
The feature set of the mobile apps is slightly behind the desktop apps.<br>
<br>
One disappointment is it has two trackers.  Hopefully these can be removed once this app enters a full release phase.<br>
<br>
The app can be used on multiple devices with a single account.  The messages that are sent and received will be synced between all devices.  However I found on the recipient's side, they will still see a &quot;user&quot; for each device.  And messages from each device only show up in that chat session for the device, so on the recipient side the messages do not sync across the device chat sessions.  So this makes a conversation confusing if someone using multiple devices sends messages from different devices.  Maybe this will be improved in the future.<br>
<br>
My verdict: I am loving it!<br>
<br>
I will wait a while and see how this app develops, but I am already loving this.  It has all the privacy features needed and runs on top of a decentralized network.  The speed is very fast, and the desktop client (MacOS) is very feature complete.  There are even some features I have not seen in any other app, such as you being able to define the undelivered message deletion time.
