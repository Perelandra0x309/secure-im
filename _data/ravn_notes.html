This app is totally anonymous, no contact information is required to sign up and it does not request access to your contacts.<br>

After sending some pictures some files were found on the Android device in /ravn/folder/images and /ravn/thumbs. These were encrypted versions of the photos so they could not be viewed outside of the Ravn app.  However, the file names are the same as the original files, so some meta data is leaked if the file name contains information.<br>
<br>
If both users are online when a message is sent then it is delivered peer to peer. If one person is not online then the message is saved temporarily on the RAVN servers until it is delivered.<br>
<br>
The app also has some unique features such as online betting and tipping for streaming content via smart contracts.  It also has an integrated cryptocurrency wallet for thier KRX tokens. You can also purchase custom icons to "hide" the application under another app icon.<br>
<br>
My verdict: Too specialized, too many trackers<br>
<br>
If you want this specifically for the features of betting and crypto trading then give this a try.  But for just a messaging application it lacks features that other apps offer.  I do appreciate that there is no contact info needed on signup and the app does not ask for access to your contacts.  The large number af trackers is worrying however, for an app that emphesizes anonymity and privacy.
