<p>BCM Messenger is a fairly new app that looks really promising.  It is currently in beta but it has been given exposure at security conferences such as DEFCON and was the official messenger of HITB 2019.  The source code is expected to be released by the end of December 2019.  The infrastructure of the network that BCM Messenger runs on top of is blockchain based which manages the servers and communications between them.  Despite the name, messages themselves are <strong>not</strong> stored on the blockchain so you do not need to fear about them being stored forever.</p>
