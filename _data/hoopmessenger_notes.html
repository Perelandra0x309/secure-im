Alias accounts can be created and linked to your master account.<br>
There is a "Vault" where you can store files encrypted by a password.<br>
The app asks for permission to access your contacts.  If you deny this, it will ask again every time you open the app which is annoying.<br>
Remotely delete all HoopMessenger data on a lost device.<br>
Currently only chats in the vault are end to end encrypted.  They do plan to make all chats E2EE in the future.<br>

Android leaks files: found photos in Local Storage/Device Storage/Android/data/com.magnificus.hoop/files.<br>

My Verdict:<br>
This messenger has a lot of promise and some great features.  I really like the alias option where you can hide your phone number.  Unfortunately not all chats are end to end encrypted, only those within the vault.  That is a security risk but they do mention that they are working on making all chats E2EE.<br>
Whenever you get out of the application and then go back in, you must re-enter the vault password to get to your encrypted messages.  This is good security, but makes using the secure messaging part more cumbersome.  This is a great app to try, but I think it would be better to wait until all messages are E2EE before using this extensively. Also the leakage of files needs to be fixed.<br>
