Whispeer is currently in beta but already is looking good.  Sending messages with text, images or audio is almost perfect.  Once during testing I received an image that was taken in the app with the camera that showed up all black, but the image could be viewed by clicking on it. The user interface is very professional looking.<br>
There is a backup key that can be retrieved from within the application and saved as text or a QR code and saved to another location.  This can be used to recover a lost password and is some kind of master key to your account.  This may be a potential vector of compromised security into the account.<br>
Contacts can be verified by having them send you their ID key or QR code.  In the web app you can see which contacts have or have not been verified.<br>
I do not receive notifications of new messages on Android.<br>
Moving to a new device: Simply download app and login and all your contacts and chat history will load.<br>
Web application:<br>
Logging into the web application gives you more features than the mobile apps, and the authors seem to be trying to make this into more of a social application.  There is a "newsfeed" wall where you can see your contacts' posts, post to your own wall, and "circles" of friends you can create. You can also select who can see information you optionally provide such as your real name, birthday, town, relationship status, education, job, gender, and language.<br>
<br>
My verdict:<br>
This messaging app/system is looking great so far.  The web app has more features than the mobile apps right now with more "social" oriented features than a simple messaging application.<br>
For the security conscious users there may be concerns that all of your message history is saved on their servers and there is a recovery key if you lose your password.  There are no whitepapers or detailed security information that I can find on their website at this time that provides specific details on their security designs.<br>
This app seems to be aiming for those who are somewhat security conscious but still want something with social media features.  It is worth a try and seeing what they will do as this becomes a more mature product.<br>
