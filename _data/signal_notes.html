What the server sees:<br>
- The phone number used for your registration.<br>
- SHA-2 Hashes of your contacts' telephone numbers to check for a match. OWS claims
  to delete this as soon as it is no longer needed.<br>
<br>
What Signal claims to keep:<br>
- The day you first joined the service<br>
- The last day you used it.<br>
<br>
Disadvantages:<br>
- People must know your phone number. It is possible to register a burner number or
  a VOIP number, but this is an advanced-use case.

My verdict: Best SMS replacement app<br>
This app may be the easiest to convince other people to use. However it requires the use of your phone number as an identifier, so if you are not comfortable giving some people your phone number there are better options to communicate with them.<br>
