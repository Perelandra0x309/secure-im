Signal is a great way to get started in the encrypted messaging world.  It works very much like standard SMS messaging apps and also uses phone numbers of your contacts just like SMS does.  When you do use encryption to send messages to other Signal users the encryption protocol used is one of the best available right now.  It takes advantage of the latest in elliptical curve cryptography, ratcheting, perfect forward secrecy, key fingerprints and ephemeral messages.<br>
<br>
One disadvantage of being similar to an SMS app however is the use of your phone number as your ID. This is a problem if you want to keep your phone number private.<br>
<br>
<div id="signal_foolproof"><em><b>Signal is not Foolproof:</b></em></div> Another issue with this app is that both encrypted Signal messages and unencrypted SMS messages are displayed on a single screen in the app.  So there is a chance of accidentally sending an unencrypted message when you really meant to send an encrypted message.  If you are trying to avoid the possibility of mistakenly sending any messages unencrypted then this app will not work for you.<br>

<br>
What the server sees:<br>
- The phone number used for your registration.<br>
- SHA-2 Hashes of your contacts' telephone numbers to check for a match. OWS claims
  to delete this as soon as it is no longer needed.<br>
<br>
What Signal claims to keep:<br>
- The day you first joined the service<br>
- The last day you used it.<br>
<br>
Disadvantages:<br>
- People must know your phone number. It is possible to register a burner number or
  a VOIP number, but this is an advanced-use case.

My verdict: Best SMS replacement app<br>
This app may be the easiest to convince other people to use. However it requires the use of your phone number as an identifier, so if you are not comfortable giving some people your phone number there are better options to communicate with them.  See my <a href="/guide_signal.html">Signal Installation Guide</a> for details on getting started with this app.<br>
