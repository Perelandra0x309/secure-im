<p>If you have a phone, there's almost no way to get away from SMS.  So the best thing you can do is protect your SMS messages at rest with encryption.

One draw back of Signal is that everyone you connect with will know your phone number, but for people you are comfortable knowing your phone number that is fine.</p>
