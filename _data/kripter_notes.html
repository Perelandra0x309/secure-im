Kripter is a secure P2P messenger app (they also have secure email).  It features self destruct messages, group chats, PIN number for self-destruct.<br>
Messages were sent very quickly. Unfortunately in practice there were too many serious bugs to make this worth keeping. Encrypted chats lost their OTR connection and we received errors that we needed an OTR plugin. Sometimes the app would just display a rotating circle and say "Loading..." and we would have to kill the app and restart it to get into existing chat sessions.  Some messages failed to burn after the allotted time.<br>
Until these bugs and issues are resolved (as of this writing Nov 26, 2017- version 1.3) I do not recommend using this application.<br>
