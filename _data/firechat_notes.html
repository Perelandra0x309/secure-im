Note: I recently revoked my recommendation of this application after discovering that it includes 4 different analytics trackers and a Facebook login module.<br>

FireChat is a unique P2P app that can work without an internet connection.  It will use bluetooth or available wifi connection (even without internet access) to create a P2P mesh network.  This can be used to communicate at social gatherings, in communities or in emergencies. You may also use it with an internet connection just as any other chat app.<br>
You can create both private chat groups and join public chat rooms.<br>
On my Android (without Google Play services) it seemed to work but it was constantly popping up a message that it required Google Play services.  Also even when not using the app and logged out of it, my wifi connection would randomly become disabled.  I determined it was FireChat, and I am not sure if that was because of missing Google Play services.<br>
Only private messages are end to end encrypted.  When logging in you will be sent a one time pin code to your email to authenticate yourself, this is used instead of a password.<br>
<br>
My verdict: Nope<br>
This app has way too much tracking in it, and it is not encrypted by default so there is too much risk of unintended leakage of information. The app also seems to want to take over the phones network and turn off wifi.<br>
