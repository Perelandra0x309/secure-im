Bottom line: Just use Conversations.<br>
<br>
Looking at the website home page I suspected it was just a XMPP server app. Then looking at the screenshots confirms this is basically a fork of Conversations. So this app is really just:
<ul>
<li>An XMPP app cloned from Conversations</li>
<li>Fixed to use their conion.im server as your account server</li>
<li>Connecting to the server over Tor</li>
</ul><br>
All of the above you can already do with the standard Conversations app on Android. But you can choose your own server. Also I would be concerned that fixes to the Conversations app would take time to make it into this build.<br>
<br>
Who is this group, where are they based? I cannot find this info. The website has poor English so they are not native speakers. The privacy page is incomplete:
https://conion.im/index.php/privacy-policy/<br>
<br>
The blog looks like all the entries came with the default Wordpress install, and they are getting nonsense comment spam.<br>
<br>
They have an icon for the iOS App store but no link. So do they plan to build Conversations of iOS as well because that would be quite a feat.<br>
<br>
Looking at the Android store entry they do at least give credit to Daniel Gultsch's Conversations there.<br>
<br>
My Verdict: Just use Conversation instead<br>
I would say stay away, I don't know who is running this server and if we can trust them. Calling this the "most secure messenger" is a stretch given the amount of meta data the server has access to.<br>
