This application is currently in beta (March 2018) and you can try it by signing up at demo.fortknoxster.com.  Signing up can be a bit tricky because only certain web browsers on a PC are allowed to be used.<br>
This product is more of a suite of systems, chat, email, cloud file storage, etc.  You can earn credits in the FKX cryptocurrency for hosting distributed cloud files, which can then be used to purchase FortKnoxster services.  No prices are available at this time.<br>
Finding contacts is by their email address.  The web application has more features than the mobile clients, including calendar and notes.  Some features like file storage is not functional yet.<br>
<br>
I did find one unencrypted image on the device data storage, which is of concern.<br>
<br>
Transferring to another device is easy, simply install the app and log in.  All contacts and chat history are loaded onto the new device.  This is good if you want this feature, however this does mean all this data is saved on their servers.<br>
<br>
My verdict:<br>
This app has potential, however one giant flaw is exposing your email address as your ID. The system is still in beta, and based in the UK (actually Gibraltar).  At this time I would say pass, but keep an eye on this.  The roadmap indicates a Q3 2018 public release.
