Update- 7/16/2018<br>
FortKnoxster is now out of beta.  Some changes are that you now need to provide a phone number instead of en email address when signing up (bad).  Your profile ID is no longer your email address and can be anything you choose (good). To add contacts you need to grant the application access to your phone's contacts list (bad).<br>

Signing up can be a bit tricky because only certain web browsers on a PC are allowed to be used: Chrome, Firefox or Opera. You can also sign up through the mobile app.<br>
This product is more of a suite of systems, chat, email, cloud file storage, etc.  You can earn credits in the FKX cryptocurrency for hosting distributed cloud files, which can then be used to purchase FortKnoxster services.  No prices are available at this time.<br>
On the mobile apps finding contacts is by their phone number, which is why the app asks for access to your contact list. You canot just enter a phone number manually to invite someone.  It will then send them an SMS message.  Strangely, inviting a contact on the web version asks you to enter their email address without requesting access to an address book.<br>
The web application has more features like file storage, it is not functional yet.<br>
<br>
I did find one unencrypted image on the device data storage, which is of concern.<br>
<br>
Transferring to another device is easy, simply install the app and log in.  All contacts and chat history are loaded onto the new device.  This is good if you want this feature, however this does mean all this data is saved on their servers.<br>
<br>
My verdict:<br>
This app has potential, however I do not like that a phone number is required to register and search for other contacts. They are based in the Gibraltar which falls under UK law.  At this time I would say pass, but keep an eye on this.
