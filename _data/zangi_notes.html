Even though the Play Store says this app requires Google Play services I had only one issue using this application with them disabled.<br>
Caution: Requires a phone number to register, uses the phone numbers in your contacts list, exposes your phone number to your Zangi contacts.<br>
Sending all types of files- audio clips, music, video, location- worked perfectly with the exception that animated gifs do not play.  Location does not work however without Google Play services.<br>
New message notifications work, and there is also a "Quick Chat" mode that allows responses to messages outside the application.<br>
Video call quality is very good even over VPN connection.  You can even continue a video call and bring up the text chat so that you still see both video feeds (you and the other person) while sending text, pictures etc.<br>
Search in chats for text.<br>
Unfortunately Zangi leaks message data, for example photos were found in /zangi/.temp and videos in /zangi/Zangi Files.<br>
<br>
My verdict:<br>
I am very impressed with this application.  I encountered no bugs and the interface is very professional.  Tons of features and very easy to use.<br>
That all said, this does expose your phone number and requires that the app has access to your contacts list to search for other Zangi users. Also the leaking of message data makes this app unsafe to use.<br>
