<ul>
  <li>Wire client sends the unencrypted, unhashed password to the central server over TLS, the server hashes the plaintext password with scrypt, and the hash is compared to the hash stored by the server.		This process leaks the user's password to the central server; the server operators (or anyone who compromises the server) could log all of the plaintext passwords as users authenticate.</li>
 <li>The desktop application is implemented as a packaged web application</li>
</ul>

 What the server sees and may save:[1]<br>
 - Your contact list is saved to the server hashed.<br>
 - Who you talk to, when, and for how long. (Needed for syncing multiple devices)

	5 Usage data
	
	Wire client applications can collect usage data with the aim of improving future
	versions of Wire. Usage data helps Wire engineers to assess how Wire is used
	and to identify areas of improvement. Usage data doesn’t contain personally
	identifiable information.
	Users can disable usage data collection at any time.
	
	5.1 Types of usage data
	Wire client applications collect several types of usage data:
	• Crash reports
	• Aggregated usage statistics
	
	5.1.1 Crash reports
	Crash reports are the version-specific per-event application state snapshots generated
	in the event of an execution failure. Usually the crash reports are generated
	when the application was terminated unexpectedly by the operating system.
	Crash reports help Wire to understand what went wrong and to release bugfixes
	faster.
	
	5.1.2 Aggregated usage statistics
	This type of data aggregates the various metrics of the application’s usage, such
	as the amount of text messages sent, images posted and calls placed as well as
	user interface flow data and events, such as a dropped call.
	This statistical data helps Wire to improve future versions.
  
	5.2 Usage and storage
	Initially the data collected is stored on the users’ devices. It is synchronized
	periodically with Wire and third-party services. Crash and exception reports
	are stored on HockeyApp [1] and Raygun [2]. All other types of usage data are
	stored on the Localytics [3] and Mixpanel [4] services.

Massive battery usage- even when not actively being used:<br>

Only on some devices, test it on your own! <br>
