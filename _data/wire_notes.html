<b>Update on 11/14/2019:</b><br>
It is very unfortunate news that Wire is now owned by a U.S. holding company and has been added into a venture capitalist company's portfolio.  Wire has also announced that they are focusing their future on enterprise deployments of their messaging system and turning away from personal users of Wire.  Therefore I have revoked my recommendation of Wire, because of concerns about U.S. control of the company and the shift in focus.<br>

<a href="https://medium.com/@wireapp/open-sourcing-wire-server-code-ef7866a731d5">Server code open sourced</a><br>
<br>
<a href="https://crysp.uwaterloo.ca/opinion/wire/">CrySP Wire analysis</a>:
<ul>
  <li>Wire client sends the unencrypted, unhashed password to the central server over TLS, the server hashes the plaintext password with scrypt, and the hash is compared to the hash stored by the server.		This process leaks the user's password to the central server; the server operators (or anyone who compromises the server) could log all of the plaintext passwords as users authenticate.</li>
 <li>The desktop application is implemented as a packaged web application</li>
</ul>

[Information provided by JR, updated by Perflyst on 1/28/2018]<br>
<br>
 What the server sees and may save:<br>
 - Your contact list is saved to the server hashed.<br>
 - Who you talk to, when, and for how long. (Needed for syncing multiple devices)

[Information <a href="https://github.com/Perelandra0x309/secure-im/pull/57">provided by SPC</a>]<br>
On some small number of Android devices notifications are an issue. The Wire support page <a href="https://support.wire.com/hc/en-us/articles/203624294-What-can-I-do-if-I-m-not-getting-any-notifications-on-Android-">lists a number of possible solutions</a> that require user intervention that other messenger apps don't seem to have. The Android app issue tracker consistently has notification bugs for Android opened.

From the <a href="https://wire-docs.wire.com/download/Wire+Privacy+Whitepaper.pdf">Privacy White Paper</a>:<br>
<blockquote>
	5 Usage data<br>
	<br>
	Wire client applications can collect usage data with the aim of improving future<br>
	versions of Wire. Usage data helps Wire engineers to assess how Wire is used<br>
	and to identify areas of improvement. Usage data doesn’t contain personally<br>
	identifiable information.<br>
	Users can disable usage data collection at any time.<br>
	<br>
	5.1 Types of usage data<br>
	Wire client applications collect several types of usage data:<br>
	• Crash reports<br>
	• Aggregated usage statistics<br>
	<br>
	5.1.1 Crash reports<br>
	Crash reports are the version-specific per-event application state snapshots generated<br>
	in the event of an execution failure. Usually the crash reports are generated<br>
	when the application was terminated unexpectedly by the operating system.<br>
	Crash reports help Wire to understand what went wrong and to release bugfixes<br>
	faster.<br>
	<br>
	5.1.2 Aggregated usage statistics<br>
	This type of data aggregates the various metrics of the application’s usage, such<br>
	as the amount of text messages sent, images posted and calls placed as well as<br>
	user interface flow data and events, such as a dropped call.<br>
	This statistical data helps Wire to improve future versions.<br>
  <br>
	5.2 Usage and storage<br>
	Initially the data collected is stored on the users’ devices. It is synchronized<br>
	periodically with Wire and third-party services. Crash and exception reports<br>
	are stored on HockeyApp [1] and Raygun [2]. All other types of usage data are<br>
	stored on the Localytics [3] and Mixpanel [4] services.

So be sure to turn off the analytics settings under Settings and Advanced:<br>

<br>
When you install Wire on a new device you are notified by email, which is a great way to know about unauthorized installs.<br>
<br>
Massive battery usage on some older Android versions and forks like CopperheadOS without Google Play Services:<br>
<img src="images/wire_battery.png"><br>
Stock Android 8.1 battery usage is much more in line with other messenger apps.<br>
<br>
Encryption process (from the whitepaper):<br>
Wire uses <a href="https://github.com/wireapp/proteus">Proteus</a>, &quot;an independent implementation of the Axolotl/Double Ratchet protocol&quot;<br>
Every client (a chat participant may have multiple clients, or devices) generates a set of pre-keys for others to use for encryption to the client.  The pre-keys are uploaded to the Wire server.  To create a new key pair with a chat participant's client one of their pre-keys is downloaded from the server.  That pre-key is then removed from the server so that each pre-key is used only once.  The sender generates their own pre-key, then the combination of the two pre-keys are used to generate the encryption key for that client.  The message is encrypted using that key, and if this is the first transaction with the client the sender's pre-key is bundled with the message so that the recipient's client can generate the decryption key.  When sending the message to multiple clients the message is encrypted once for each client, and the bundle is sent to the Wire server for delivery to each one.<br>
Once an initial message is sent to establish the key used between two clients, ratcheting is used to automatically advance to new keys during multiple message exchanges.  This provides forward secrecy for the encrypted message and also allows messages to be ephemeral.<br>

<br>
My verdict: <strike>Very solid app with great interface</strike> Wire no longer caters to the free personal messaging sector, controlled by U.S. ownership<br>
<br>
<strike>This is one of the best apps as far as features and usability, and while not perfect gives you great security as well.  With apps that sync across multiple devices it is also great at keeping a conversation going no matter what device you are using.</strike><br>
Wire is now focused on delivering enterprise services, has removed all references to personal use of Wire from its website.  They claim to perhaps deliver a &quot;freemium&quot; level in the future.  Wire has taken a huge business risk/reward gamble by selling to venture capitalists in the hopes of accelerated growth in the enterprise market.  Say goodbye to meeting the needs of personal users.
