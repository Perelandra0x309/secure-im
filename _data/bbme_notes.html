One of the giants and original secure messaging platforms BlackBerry Messenger is now opening up it's enterprise application to everyone.  This is great news for adoption of secure messaging:<br>

I was very excited to try this app now that it is available without a corporate account.  The new publicly available accounts will be free for the first year, the fee is $2.49 every 6 months.  This is a very reasonable price for such an app.<br>

If you use an alternate Android OS such as LineageOS and are trying to stay away from Google, BBMe could present some trouble for you in signing up.  You need to have a Play Store account and a valid payment method setup in order to create a subscription.  I ran into this problem because I don't use a personal Google account anymore, and one I did have for non-personal reasons doesn't allow a payment method to be added so I was unable to signup on Android.  My solution was to instead sign up on an iPhone with my Apple Store account.  Then once all setup on an iPhone you are able to install the app and sign in with your BlackBerry Messenger PIN without needed to verify a payment method on Android.<br>

OK I just have to shout this from the rooftops, because this is a feature that is very rare in other messengers.  BBMe gives you an option on whether it saves photos you take in BBMe to your photo gallery, or NOT!  Yes, I have a choice!!  So I can turn this feature off, and be sure any photos in BBMe stay only in BBMe and are not leaked.  Thank you!<br>

BBMe does have ephemeral messages (called &quot;Timed messages&quot;) however the timeout options are very short- only up to 60 seconds at most.  This means that all messages that are ephemeral expire very quickly.  I prefer to have a timeout option of up to several weeks, so I can keep messages for a little while if I need to review them, but they do eventually get deleted.<br>
<br>
There is no Perfect Forward Secrecy for messages and no contact fingerprint or verification, which is disappointing.  However there is a &quot;Feeds&quot; section in BBMe which will alert you when any of your contact's keys change.  But there still is not any real way to verify that the key you see matches the key on their device.<br>
<br>
The chat sessions have lots of features including quoting, editing and retracting your sent messages, deleting messages (on your device only), search, screenshot alerts, mentioning participants, and delivery and read receipts for every person in the chat.<br>
<br>
My verdict: Great app, I wish it had more advanced security features<br>
<br>
Overall BlackBerry Messenger Enterprise is a great app with a solid history.  The encryption is robust and the chat experience is very nice.  Unfortunately without perfect forward secrecy, very short ephemeral message timeouts, and no contact key verification options this app is missing several security features offered by other apps.  It is also based in Canada if you are concerned about 5 Eyes.
