[A big thank you to the cool cat (you know who you are) who helped me test BBMe and pointed out some things I missed.]<br>

One of the giants and first to the secure messaging arena is BlackBerry Messenger.  This app is now opening up it's enterprise application to everyone.  This is great news for adoption of secure messaging:<br>

I was very excited to try this app now that it is available without a corporate account.  The new publicly available accounts will be free for the first year, then the fee is US $2.49 every 6 months.  This is a very reasonable price for such an app.<br>
<br>
If you use an alternate Android OS such as LineageOS and are trying to stay away from Google, BBMe could present some trouble for you in signing up.  You need to have a Play Store account and a valid payment method setup in order to create a subscription.  I ran into this problem because I don't use a personal Google account anymore.  My solution was to instead sign up on an iPhone with my Apple Store account.  Then once all setup on an iPhone you are able to install the app on Android and sign in with your BlackBerry Messenger PIN without needing to verify a payment method in the Play Store.<br>

Data leakage (especially photos) prevented!  BBMe gives you an option on whether it saves photos to your phone's photo gallery, or keeps them encrypted only in the BBMe database!  I love that BBMe give me a choice!!  I can turn this feature off, and be sure any photos in BBMe stay only in BBMe and are not leaked.  Thank you!  All other data is also saved encrypted on the device in a BBMe exclusive database.<br>

BBMe does have &quot;Timed messages&quot; however these cannot really be considered &quot;ephemeral&quot; messages.  These timed messages set a timer for the message to expire once they have been read by the recipient.  However the timeout options are very short- only up to 60 seconds at most and the timeout period only begins once a message has been read.  Therefore it is possible that a message is never read and it will never expire.  Also this feature is reset upon every new message to be disabled, so it is not a feature that can be easily used to ensure every message will expire after it is read.  With such a short timeout and no way to set this timeout as a permanent or always on feature the timeout is really only practical for the most sensitive messages.  To me this feature isn't very useful except in rare circumstances so I can't set ephemeral messages as a listed feature of BBMe.<br>
<br>
One feature I do really like is &quot;Retractable&quot; messages.  Any message you send can be retracted and the message contents will be deleted from all recipient's devices if possible.  There will still be a message remaining that just says &quot;Message retracted&quot; on the recipient's devices so there will be some meta data remaining that shows a message was sent.  This remaining data can be deleted as well just like any other message but this is an additional step that must be done on  each device.  There is also an option to retract an entire chat.  If you do this then create a new chat with your recipients then you are essentially forcing a complete key change for a conversation and deleting all history.  This is a nice feature to have to be able to cleanup old conversations or easily keep the amount of data retained on devices very low.<br>
<br>
There is a &quot;Feeds&quot; section in BBMe which will alert you when any of your contact's keys change.  Each contact has a key fingerprint that you can compare in person or using another communication channel to verify the key you see matches the key on their device.<br>
<br>
BBM is a mature product, so the chat session does have lots of useful features including quoting, editing and retracting your sent messages, deleting messages (on your device only), search, screenshot alerts, mentioning participants, and delivery and read receipts for every person in the chat. You can also use audio and video chat and on desktop versions do screen sharing.  In the chat room details there are some notification options, sections which show all pictures, files and links from the chat grouped together, and a list of all room participants.  Groups are able to have up to 250 participants at once.<br>
<br>
If you are able to meet in person, there is a handy way to add a contact by scanning their QR code or through NFC.  Otherwise you can add contacts by searching for their BlackBerry PIN, email or phone number.<br>
<br>
This app is available for multiple platforms on mobile and desktop devices, so this makes it a great option for almost anyone to use.  Messages are synced perfectly when you have this installed on multiple devices, and the interface experience is fairly consistant between the various operating system options.  This versatility to use BBMe almost anywhere is an advantage over many other messengers.<br>
<br>
My verdict: It has the security features you need, only a couple things I wish were better<br>
<br>
Overall BlackBerry Messenger Enterprise is a great app with a solid history.  The encryption is robust and the chat experience is very nice. 
For a centralized system it has the security features that are required to be a recommendation.  I wish it had longer message timeouts and a way to set all messages to timeout by default.  Also it would be very nice if there were a Linux client for the desktop.  The three trackers are more than I would prefer to have in a secure messenger.
<br>Note that BlackBerry is based in Canada if you are concerned about 5 Eyes.
