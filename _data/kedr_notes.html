Kedr provides a good selection of messaging features including sharing audio clips and video chats.  It also allows you to request the deletion of messages from all devices.  I found no real issues or bugs with the app which worked very well.<br>
<br>
I was not able to find very much information about the technical details of how the app works.  The website has very little information, and the only thing I was able to find was when the app asks for permissions to access your contacts it gives the reason &quot;to find other Matrix users based on their email and phone numbers&quot;.  So I take this to mean that Kedr is using the Matrix protocol, however I am not able to confirm that yet.  I did try to do a search for contacts using known Matrix accounts used on the main Matrix.org network, however no results were found so if this is based on Matrix it appears to be on a totally separate Matrix network.  This might be a good thing if you are concerned about data privacy issues using Riot/Matrix.<br>
<br>
Providing an email or phone number is optional, as well as giving access to your contacts list.  I was also pleased that on Android I could not find any trace of files saved by Kedr in the public storage area so this app seems to have been built correctly regarding the safe storage of data in private app file space.<br>
<br>
My verdict- I want to know more<br>
<br>
Without technical details on how this app works I cannot give it a complete review, however I do like what I see.  I found no major issues with usage or data privacy.<br>
