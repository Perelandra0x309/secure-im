No multi device syncing.<br>
Does not scan your contacts list (thank you!)<br>
Polling is an option if Google services are not installed for Android<br>
On Copperhead Hoccer times out after a while and messages are not received, you must open the application to reestablish a connection.<br>
Android leaks files: found photos in Local Storage/Device Storage/Hoccer<br>
<br>
My verdict:<br>
Nice application that preserves your privacy by not requiring personal info to sign up, does not scan your contacts and does not expose personal info to other users.  It is very unfortunate that the client leaks data on Android.<br>
