Cwtch is based on the Ricochet platform and uses Tor onion services.<br>

Cwtch is an experimental concept and prototype. We do not recommend you use Cwtch today if you require secure communication.

This project looks very interesting being built upon Ricochet protocols, I am interesting in seeing how it develops.  On stock Android the application would open for a few seconds then crash so I was not able to test it.  However I do like the concept of a decentralized network and using Tor.  Give this one some time to develop.<br>
<br>
My verdict: Still alpha, keep an eye on this one<br>
<br>
I like the concepts, it just needs time to develop.
