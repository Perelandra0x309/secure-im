We attempted to test this application on iOS, and were able to successfully invite and connect two devices.  However after initiating a conversation messages from one participant never were received by the other participant, while messages were receive in the opposite direction.<br>
Then the app was installed on Android and logged in with the same user that couldn't see messages on iOS.  This time messages were all restored and could be seen.<br>
Clicking on one photo brought up a black screen and photo could not be viewed, although it was seen as a preview in the chat session.<br>
Android client leaks files, photo found at /Local storage/cashewnut_DB/Media (the one I couldn't view in the app).<br>
<br>
My verdict: Some nice security features, leaks files<br>
<br>
The iOS app had issues sending messages, and the Android client saved photos to a publicly accessable folder.  There were some nice features like delayed sending and notification if screenshots are taken but the issues of leaked files and messages not being received are too great to be able to recommend this app.<br>
