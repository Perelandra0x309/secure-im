Zom is an XMPP client that is derived from the ChatSecure open source client.  This app aims to be easy to use and respects your privacy.  Zom is very easy to signup a new account on- just pick a username and that is it.  No requirement for email or phone number.<br>
<br>
There are no trackers included in this app, which is very nice!<br>
<br>
You can chat with fellow Zom users, but also with any other person who has an XMPP account on other servers.  Although I did find sometimes that transferring text or photos with my account on a non-Zom server resulted in an undecryptable data object.  But most of the time text and photos were received just fine.  Zom also has stickers you can send to other Zom users.<br>

This app uses the otr4j library, which is still in development, so some caution is advised:
<blockquote>
As OTRv4 is still in draft, the implementation of this otr4j implementation itself is not stable (or secure).
Status: In active development
Current work should be considered at most prototype-quality and guaranteed insecure. The development follows the master branch of OTRv4, but may lag behind in areas that currently lack development focus.
</blockquote>
The elliptical curve used is a slightly older one, and other apps are currently using the newer and faster ECDH25519 but the ECDH448 is still plenty strong enough.<br>
<br>
On Android I could find no evidence of any files or folders saved by Zom onto public storage where other apps could access them.  This is quite rare and the developers should be congratulated for such attention to security.<br>
<br>
My verdict: Overall excellent work<br>
<br>
I am impressed be the quality of the work in making this app secure and easy to use at the same time.  There are no trackers, no leaked files, and mostly a smooth experience chatting with even XMPP users on other servers.  One caution is the status of the OTRv4 implementation which is not final yet.  But overall very good work and it just needs a little more polishing.<br>
