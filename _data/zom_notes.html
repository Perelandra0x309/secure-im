Update on May 8, 2022:<br>
I have learned that Zom is now using the Matrix SDK2 to interact with Matrix accounts, it is no longer using XMPP.<br>
<br>
I logged into Zom using an existing matrix account and basic messaging does work.  However there does not appear to be any way to join group rooms, or use newer features like spaces. There also doesn't seem to be much development activity, only 1 or two code changes per month.<br>
<br>
The website still references XMPP and is very out of date, and no mention about the change to Matrix.<br>
<br>
My verdict: Very basic client, use something else<br>
<br>
This is dissapointing that the change to Matrix was made but only a very small feature set of Matrix is actually used.
