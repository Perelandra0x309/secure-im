June 2021- Amazon acquires Wickr to add to its AWS service offerings: <a href="https://www.slashgear.com/amazon-buys-wickr-a-secure-messaging-platform-even-the-nsa-likes-25679984/">https://www.slashgear.com/amazon-buys-wickr-a-secure-messaging-platform-even-the-nsa-likes-25679984/</a>.  This looks like a way to secure future contracts with the US Govt.<br>

WickrMe synchronizes your chats across all your devices.  Actually what happens is there is a separate message encrypted for each registered device you have.  So if any devices are offline, those messages will be stored temporarily on the server until the device is online and is able to retrieve the message.  Messages are stored for up to 6 days, after which they expire and are deleted from the server.<br>
<br>
All messages expire, with the timeout beginning once the message has been read.  You can choose a timeout of up to 6 days.  This is a nice feature that you can have peace of mind that all messages will be deleted.<br>
<br>
The desktop clients work very well and make it easy to transition between messaging on a mobile devices and doing so on a desktop.  It is available for all major platforms including Ubuntu Linux.<br>
<br>
There are not many unique features, but as a basic chat client it works very well.  It has video chat (I haven't tried that yet), audio messages and file transfers.  Notifications are reliable even on Lineage for MicroG.<br>
<br>
Encryption process (from the <a href="https://github.com/WickrInc/wickr-crypto-c/wiki">wiki</a>):<br>
Each device that a WickrMe user uses is considered a node with it's own set of encryption keys.  Each node creates a pool of asymmetric Diffie-Hellman public key pairs and sends the public keys to the WickrMe server.  These are available for other nodes to use for sending messages.<br>
When sending a message, a copy of the encrypted message packet is sent to all of the nodes of the recipient, plus to all the other nodes of the sender so that all the sender's devices also remain in sync.  Every node receives an exact copy of the same message bundle, it is packaged so that all recipient nodes can decrypt the same message bundle.<br>
One random symmetric key is generated which encrypts the actual message data.  Then a new public key pair is generated on the sender's device to use once for this message bundle.  One public key is retrieved from the pool of each node that will receive the message. The sender node's private key and each one of the repient nodes' public key is used to encrypt the symmetric message encryption key.  So there will be N copies of the symmetric key encrypted and included in the message bundle.  Then the encrypted message data, all the encrypted copies of the symmetric key and the public key of the sender's node is packaged together into the final message bundle which is sent to all the recipient nodes.<br>
So one important question with this model, is it a risk having data (in this instance it happens to be the symmetric message encryption key) encrypted multiple times with different key pairs for each recipient and having all those copies included with the message bundle for all other recipents to access?  If one node receives encrypted data intended for all the other nodes, encrypted with their keys, doesn't that expose a risk that one node could break the private key used by another node?  The answer is yes that is a theoretical risk, but not a practical one.  The reason is that each public key used to encrypt the actual message encryption key is only ever used once then destroyed.  So yes having a known piece of data encrypted with multiple keys does make it theoretically easier to break any of the other secret keys needed to decrypt the message.  However, this message was also sent to you, so you already know the contents of this message!  Nothing is revealed that you do not already know.  And since any private keys you may discover are never used again, they cannot be used to decrypt any other messages. (Note, I sent a question to Wickr and confirmed with them that in fact each public/private key pair between nodes is only used one time and discarded.)<br>
<br>
My verdict: One of the very best, however concerns about country jurisdiction and trackers and ownership!<br>
<br>
This app has a complete set of security features, and is practically "foolproof", by which I mean you can just use it and not worry about doing something that will compromise the security of your messages.  At most your messages will sit around on your chat partners device or the WickrMe server (encrypted of course) for 6 days before being automatically deleted.  Also it requires no personal information making it very anonymous.  It does what it is supposed to do simply without a lot of flash.<br>
<br>
The only downside is that the system is owned by Amazon and based in the USA (part of the 5 eyes) and I usually stay away from any messaging apps with servers there. However I am very confident in the security and anonymity of the system so this is one of the few messengers based in the US that I do use.  You can also see their <a href="https://wickr.com/privacy/#transparency">transparency report</a>.  The three trackers in the app are more than I would prefer it to have as well.<br>
