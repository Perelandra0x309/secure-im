WickrMe synchronizes your chats across all your devices.  Actually what happens is there is a separate message encrypted for each registered device you have.  So if any devices are offline, those messages will be stored temporarily on the server until the device is online and is able to retrieve the message.  Messages are stored for up to 6 days, after which they expire and are deleted from the server.<br>
<br>
All messages expire, with the timeout beginning once the message has been read.  You can choose a timeout of up to 6 days.  This is a nice feature that you can have peace of mind that all messages will be deleted.<br>

The desktop clients work very well and make it easy to transition between messaging on a mobile devices and doing so on a desktop.  It is available for all major platforms including Ubuntu Linux.<br>
<br>
There are not many unique features, but as a basic chat client it works very well.  It has video chat (I haven't tried that yet), audio messages and file transfers.  Notifications are reliable even on Lineage for MicroG.<br>
<br>
My verdict: One of the very best!<br>
<br>
This app has a complete set of security features, and is practically "foolproof", by which I mean you can just use it and not worry about doing something that will compromise the security of your messages.  At most your messages will sit around on your chat partners device or the WickrMe server (encrypted of course) for 6 days before being automatically deleted.  Also it requires no personal information making it very anonymous.  It does what it is supposed to do simply without a lot of flash.<br>
<br>
The only downside is that the system is based in the USA (part of the 5 eyes) and I usually stay away from any messaging apps with servers there. However I am very confident in the security and anonymity of the system so this is one of the few messengers based in the US that I do use.
