Access to contacts is essentially required- On iOS I could not add a new contact by manually adding a phone number.  On Android I was able to start a new chat and manually type in a phone number.  I could not add the contact to the app's contact list on either app<br>
<br>
When I first made contact from my Android to iPhone it kept generating new keys.  Although throughout the messaging test period I noticed every once in a while it would show a message on iOS that new keys had been generated, so maybe this is how it provides perfect forward secrecy.  I did not see these messages on the Android.<br>
<br>
The app does have ephemeral messages that can be set to expire from 5 minutes to 5 days.  Unfortunately setting the timer only applies to the that message sent, it then reverts back to no timeout for the next message.  There is no default ephemeral timeout setting.<br>
<br>
On the Android device all pictures sent and received were saved unencrypted in /Android/data/com.accelior.vega/files/Pictures<br>
<br>
My Verdict: Not private enough<br>
<br>
The app worked well, however major concerns are the use of your phone number as your identifier and a requirement to give access to your phone's contacts list.  The app also saves files unencrypted in public storage for any app to access.  If you want to use your phone number other apps like Signal are more private and secure.
