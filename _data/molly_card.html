<p>Molly is a fork of Signal for Android that adds a few features and also removes the ability to use regular SMS in the app.  There are two flavors of the app, one with Google Firebase and Maps and one without so this provides an additional option for more privacy from Google.  One draw back of Molly is that everyone you connect with will know your phone number, but for people you are comfortable knowing your phone number that is fine.</p>
