If you take a screenshot there is a note posted in the chat.<br>
On iOS there is no preview of photos sent or received, you must touch on the link to view the photo.  However there is a preview in the Android app. Decryption the first time on iOS seems to take a while. Accessing the photo again is quick.<br>
On iOS there is the option to setup your fingerprint authentication to open the application<br>
When testing with "C" on iOS, his app crashed and locked him out for some time with the spinning circle of death. After a reboot and waiting a little while he was able to log back in, then the app would not accept his password.<br>
On Android some buttons do not respond well and need some extended touching to activate. To enter a chat I had to click on the notification, pressing on the chat entry in the app does nothing.  Swiping between the main screen sections of Contacts, Chats and Settings is not obvious at first and touching each heading does not move to that section.<br>
I received the error "connect_to_internet_prompt_title connect_to_internet_prompt" when I lost internet connectivity while moving around. Seems like a template of error messages has not been update with relavent error message text.<br>

There are many bugs and outright broken things in the apps on both platforms that make them painful to use. The security on the backend seems to be adequate with what little information I could get from the website, but there needs to be more documentation, FAQs and details on the encryption used.  Much needs to be improved before I would even consider this worthy of trying.<br>
