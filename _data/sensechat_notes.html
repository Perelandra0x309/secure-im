SenseChat is a messaging app the stores your public key on the blockchain that anyone can verify and use to send a message.  Messages are sent peer to peer if possible, but if not they will be temporarily saved on a SenseChat server until they can be delivered.<br>
<br>
When searching for contacts in the app you can type in any letter and get many results that match the first part of the user name to what you are searching. This seems like a privacy issue, but then again all public keys are stored on the public blockchain anyway, so there is no way to really keep all user identities of the service a secret.<br>
<br>
The username you choose must be exactly 12 characters, I supposed to conform to requirements of the blockchain?<br>
<br>
My verdict- Not mature and too many trackers<br>
<br>
This app has fewer features than most other messaging apps.  I also have concerns about the public nature of the blockchain and the ability to look up any and all user names that are registered in the system.
