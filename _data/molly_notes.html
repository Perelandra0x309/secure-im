Molly is a fork of the Signal messenger app that adds a few more security features, removes the ability to send normal unencrypted SMS messages and also has a build that removes Google Firebase and Maps libraries.  This alternative to Signal uses up to date source code from the official Signal clients so works in almost exacty the same way as the official application.  If you already use Signal then creating a backup of your Signal data and importing it into Molly works perfectly.
<br>
One advantage I feel Molly has over Signal is that Molly removes the ability to send regular unencrypted SMS messages, thus making Molly a foolproof encrypted messenger.  There is no way to mistakenly send an unencrypted message, because you can only send messages to other Signal/Molly users.  This does mean that you will need to use a separate SMS app for regular SMS messages but I feel this should be the way people use SMS.

Molly also adds several security and privacy features such as:
<ul>
<li>Data encryption at rest - Protect the database with passphrase encryption</li>
<li>Secure RAM wiper - Securely shred sensitive data from device memory</li>
<li>Automatic lock - Lock the app automatically under certain conditions</li>
<li>Block unknown contacts - Block messages and calls from unknown senders for security and anti-spam</li>
<li>Contact deletion - Allows you to delete contacts and stop sharing your profile</li>
<li>Disappearing call history - Clear call notifications together with expiring messages</li>
<li>Debug logs are optional - Android logging can be disabled</li>
<li>Custom backup scheduling - Choose between daily or weekly interval and the number of backups to retain</li>
<li>SOCKS proxy and Tor support - Tunnel app network traffic via proxy and Orbot</li>
</ul>

Molly uses the Signal encryption protocol which is one of the best available right now.  It takes advantage of the latest in elliptical curve cryptography, ratcheting, perfect forward secrecy, key fingerprints and ephemeral messages.<br>

See my review on <a href="https://securechatguide.org/centralizedapps.html#signal">Signal</a> for more details on how the core functionality of Molly stands up, since Molly os forked from Signal with some minor changes.

My verdict: Excellent alternative to Signal<br>
If you already use Signal then this option may appeal to you if you wish to gain even more freedom from Google or don't like that Signal can also send unencrypted SMS messages.  This apps works almost identical to Signal and is fully compatible with messaging to both Signal and Molly users.
