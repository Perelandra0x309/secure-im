Squirel is currently by invite only, alpha software at this time.<br>
Encryption looks to be available in the Secret Rooms only.<br>
The app looks like a clone of Discord, very similar setup with groups, rooms, groups chats, direct messages.  Currently trying to create a new Direct Message brings you to a blank screen and there does not seem to be any way to add or search for other Squirrel users.<br>
Signup requires that you use the phone number of the phone you are using, trying a different alternate phone number fails.  Signup requires you to enter your first and last name and birthdate (though these are not verified).<br>
<br>
My verdict: pass<br>
Early software, encryption not the defualt, Yahoo history of data leaks.  So far no real information about security features in place.<br>
