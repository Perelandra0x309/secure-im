The Android client has some bugs, when sending a message to it from the web or iOS client the messages would not appear unless you return to the contacts list then go back into the chat. Also When attempting to send a photo it started to encrypt it but then got stuck and the app had to be forcibly quit.  There were also many messages sent from the Andoid client that had an error message displayed below them that "Message not sent", however the message was received on the other side.<br>
Within the chat you can enable "Secret Sending" whcih requires you to enter the account password again to reveal each message.  Also in regular chat mode there are no previews of photos, you need to click on the image to view it.<br>
The app ID is com.sygnul.sygnul.  Not sure if that it an homage or a rip on Signal.<br>
There are not ephemeral messages that you specify a particular timeout for deletion, however you can "Unsend" messages.<br>
There are sections of the app for Events, My Stuff, and Broadcasts.  These seem to be an effort to provide colaboration features as well.<br>
From the Security Architecture paper:
<blockquote>
<pre>
Information and Data Access
Conclave is a security and privacy centered application and is committed to being a trusted steward of
user information. While the conclave system is designed to safeguard all user data, some user data is not
encrypted, though it is protected. The information that is not encrypted with a user’s private keys is 
provided, in addition to how it is utilized within the conclave system. This data is protected by the secure
infrastructure Conclave has built and Conclave’s adherence to data protection compliance.

User Name
Purpose: Usernames are used to login to the conclave system. Additionally, users can search for
contacts by username.

First Name and Last Name
Purpose: Conclave stores users first and last names unencrypted to allow users to search for
contacts by name and to allow them to see the names of other users.

Email Address
Purpose: Conclave uses the user’s email address to contact them for verification during certain
system processes, and to send special offers, alerts, and updates using Mail Chimp. The
user can opt-out of these non-critical emails.

User-links and Status
Purpose: Conclave stores the “contact” relationships between users to allow user’s contact lists to
be synchronized between devices and to perform server-side searches of contacts by
username, first name, or last name.

File Directory Structure
Purpose: To allow users to organize and manage their files in a familiar way, Conclave provides
a file directory feature (“folders”). The names of these directories are stored in plain
text to provide support for server-side sorting and paging.

File Names
Purpose: In support of the file directory structure feature, Conclave stores file names in plain text
to provide support for server-side sorting and paging.

Event Metadata
Purpose: To provide the user with persistent notifications of events involving them in the system,
Conclave stores this data so that it is available when requested by the web app to
provide a “Notifications” interface.

Conversation Metadata
Purpose: Conclave allows users to conduct conversations between fixed groups of users with
persistent histories that are available on all of a user’s devices. While the content of
each of the messages in the conversation are end-to-end encrypted, Conclave must store
the participants involved in each conversation as well as the time each message was sent.

File/Folder Share Metadata
Purpose: To allow users to send and share files and folders to one-another, the Conclave system
must know which file or folder is to be shared or sent with which user(s). In the case of
sharing, a list of the users who have access to the file/folder must be maintained so that
the server knows which users it may serve the encrypted file or folder data to and so that
it can store the encrypted key for that file/folder for each shared user.

Support Tickets
Purpose: When you contact Conclave to provide feedback or request support, we keep a record
of this communication to help solve any issues. We may use this information for internal or
external reporting, or to inform you of changes being made to the system to resolve your
submission.

My verdict: Good start?<br>
Even in normal mode there are so many times you need to enter your password again to do something, it seems a little overkill. The Android app still has some major bugs. Overall it is difficult to use with so many things hindering just simple chatting (no photo previews, passwords needed often).<br>
However I do appreciate the focus on security of all the data, everything is encrypted locally.  They do keep track of contacts and other meta data on the server, so be sure you are comfortable with those items listed above.
