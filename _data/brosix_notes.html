Peer-to-Peer Connections  – All communication channels between users are preferably peer-to-peer. If a direct connection is unable to be made, the communication passes through a tunnel server. With this, the sender encrypts the data with the recipient decrypting. Also, it’s important to note that the tunnel server never sees the data, never processes the data, and never stores the data.<br>

This application was recently updated with a much improved user interface and usability.  Sending text and pictures worked great and the location feature integrates nicely with the default Maps application on Android.  If you have the Maps app disabled however the app will crash if you try to open a location marker in the app.<br>

Brosix used to support connections to AIM, Google Talk and ICQ, however that is being dropped as of April 1, 2019 (probably a good thing).<br>
<br>
My verdict: Definitely worth a try, much improved this year!<br>

What I like is a much cleaner interface since the last version, the company is based outside the 14 eyes countries and it has a desktop application.  It is still missing some security features like ephemeral messages and contact verification.  It does get a bonus for not having any tracker libraries.<br>
