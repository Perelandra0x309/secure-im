Peer-to-Peer Connections  – All communication channels between users are preferably peer-to-peer. If a direct connection is unable to be made, the communication passes through a tunnel server. With this, the sender encrypts the data with the recipient decrypting. Also, it’s important to note that the tunnel server never sees the data, never processes the data, and never stores the data.<br>

The Android application is very very basic, looks like something from Windows 98.  I can only see a couple words at one time while composing a message. There are no settings at all avalable within the application.<br>
