The SIMSme encryption key is tied to the phone and cannot be transfered to another.  Requires a phone number to register.<br>
Invite contacts based on their phone number.  SIMSme checks your address book for existing registered users.<br>
Three levels of contact trust- High, Medium and Low.<br>
Self destructing messages.<br>
It gives an error on Android without Google Play Services that it won't run, but it seems to work.<br>
<br>
My verdict: Solid app to communicate with those who know your phone number<br>
This app is well done, didn't find any major issues with the apps or functionality.  Offers great features like self destruct messages and delayed sending. This does require that your contacts know your phone number which is the only real drawback of this app.<br>
