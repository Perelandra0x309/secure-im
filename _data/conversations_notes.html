Android leaks files: found photos in Local Storage/Device Storage/Conversations/Media<br>
<br>
My Verdict: The best xmpp app, but security is an afterthought<br>
XMPP was not designed with security at it's core.  Therefore be careful of data leakage.  Until that is resolved Conversations is not a secure IM app.  Even if these flaws are fixed however, you are still exposed if others are using clients that may also have data leakage.<br>
