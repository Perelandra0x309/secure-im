My verdict: Stay Away!<br>
It is very concerning that such lax security practices (weak password rules, no message authentication or integrity validation) were allowed to be a part of the design in the first place.<br>
Also the desktop clients are written in JavaScript which is easily modified to bypass security checks.<br>
Did they fix these issues?  Maybe but without open code to inspect we cannot know.
