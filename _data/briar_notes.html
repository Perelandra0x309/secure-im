Pros:<br>
Secure P2P encryption<br>
On F-Droid<br>
Does not require Google Play services<br>
Works over <a href="https://briarproject.org/how-it-works.html">wifi, bluetooth or Tor</a><br>
Cons:<br>
Android only<br>
Pro or Con:<br>
Requires physical presence of contacts for initial verification (by design)<br>
Transferring to another Android phone: There does not seem to be a possible way to preserve your account or data, you can recreate another account with the same name on the new phone.<br>
<br>
On Copperhead, the battery optimization settings need to be set to Off so that it will remain connected.<br>
Android battery use is very high, even with battery optimization turned on.<br>
<br>
My verdict: Good option for specific use case.<br>
By that I mean it is good if:
<ul>
  <li>You can meet your contacts in person</li>
  <li>You and your contacts all use Android</li>
  <li>You want the option to be able to communicate outside the standard internet</li>
</ul>
