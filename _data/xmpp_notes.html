<blockquote>
What the server sees:[1]<br>
- Your plaintext chats unless you use encryption such as OTR, PGP, or OMEMO.<br>
- Your contact list is saved to the server in plaintext<br>
- Precise time you logged in or out<br>
- Precise time you sent any messages to a contact and what messages they send you.<br>
- Whether you are online or not, and your status.<br>
- Who you contacted, when, and how frequently.<br>
- SHA-1 hash of your password. Improperly configured servers may store passwords in plaintext.

My verdict: The best option for a wide base of users.<br>
XMPP is a protocol, and clients are built on top of that so there are many options across all platforms which will help adoptability.<br>
One drawback is the clients are all different so there is a lack of consistency in experience and features across platforms.<br>
