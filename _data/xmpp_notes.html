<br>
My verdict: A great option for a wide base of users.  However beware of data leakage.<br>
XMPP is a protocol, and clients are built on top of that so there are many options across all platforms which will help adoptability.<br>
One drawback is the clients are all different so there is a lack of consistency in experience and features across platforms. Also you do not know which client your chat partner is using, so even if you use a secure client on your device you have no guarantees that they are using a secure client.<br>
