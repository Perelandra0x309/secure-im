Telegram channels are monitored by Telegram and government authorities. Telegram <a href="https://www.recode.net/2017/12/30/16833542/telegram-iran-demostrations-messaging-protests-pavel-durov">shuts down a public channel</a> then <a href="https://www.dailydot.com/debug/iran-protests-telegram-instagram-apps/">Iran shuts off access to Telegram</a><br>
The CEO of Telegram shows an unwillingness to consider that encrypting communications may actually preserve freedom of speech:<br>

<a href="https://core.telegram.org/mtproto">MTProto protocol</a>: This is a roll-your-own protocol by Telegram (not a good idea).  All traffic is encrypted by MTProto Part I encryption, but this is only between the client device and the server.  Only secret chats are encrypted end to end using MTProto Part II.<br>
<br>
<a href="https://telegram.org/privacy#2-storing-data">Data storage</a>:
<ul>
  <li>Telegram stores regular cloud chats encrypted on their servers but they control all the encryption keys.</li>
  <li>All your contacts' phone numbers and names are stored on their servers.</li>
  <li>Android leaks files: found photos in Local Storage/Device Storage/Android/data/org.telegram.messenger.  When you log out of Telegram it says that it will kill all your secret chats, however the photos remain saved on the device.</li>

Link Previews:<br>
Telegram provides previews (pictures, text) of website links that you send in messages.  The app actively monitors what you type when writing a message and will send a request to the Telegram servers when it detects a URL has been typed.  The Telegram servers pull data from the typed URL so that only the server IP is exposed, not your device IP.  This been verified by myself by typing in the URL of this website in a Telgram chat and looking at the web server's access log files:<br>
<blockquote>
149.154.161.8 - - [05/Jan/2019:19:48:44 -0500] "GET / HTTP/1.1" 200 21112 "-" "TelegramBot (like TwitterBot)"<br>
149.154.161.17 - - [05/Jan/2019:19:49:41 -0500] "GET /test HTTP/1.1" 404 202 "-" "TelegramBot (like TwitterBot)"<br>
149.154.161.12 - - [05/Jan/2019:19:50:04 -0500] "GET /testq HTTP/1.1" 404 203 "-" "TelegramBot (like TwitterBot)"<br>
149.154.161.12 - - [05/Jan/2019:19:50:13 -0500] "GET /testqfghfd HTTP/1.1" 404 208 "-" "TelegramBot (like TwitterBot)"

I paused a few times as I was typing and so several URL were retrieved.<br>
This feature is even available in Secret Chats.  When I opened a new secret chat and typed in a URL I was prompted if I wanted to enable this feature:<br>
<img src="images/telegram_link_preview.png"><br>
So what this means is the link preview feature is available for use in Secret Chats, and so this would leak data to the Telegram server.  It ALSO means that in Secret Chats the functionality that actively monitors what you type is fully functional.  This is a concern because it might be possible to abuse this feature to monitor secret chats.<br>

Metadata leakage:<br>

  publicly viewable.<br>
- Who you talk to, when, and the precise time you send a message, and how frequently
  is publicly viewable via commandline tools.<br>
- If an attacker knows your phone number, the attacker will be able to silently log
  your Telegram activity without you knowing about it or being informed they have you

My verdict: Too many problems with the protocol and data storage!<br>
<br>
There are many issues with the protocol as shown by the referenced papers above.  Rolling your own crypto is hard and MTProto has many problems.<br>
Also all your phone contacts are stored on their servers, link previews get retrieved through the servers and non-secret chats are accessible to Telegram.  Photos are stored in the system wide accessible local device storage even for secret chats.<br>
