Telegram channels are monitored by Telegram and government authorities. Telegram <a href="https://www.recode.net/2017/12/30/16833542/telegram-iran-demostrations-messaging-protests-pavel-durov">shuts down a public channel</a> then <a href="https://www.dailydot.com/debug/iran-protests-telegram-instagram-apps/">Iran shuts off access to Telegram</a><br>
The CEO of Telegram shows an unwillingness to consider that encrypting communications may actually preserve freedom of speech:<br>

<a href="https://core.telegram.org/mtproto">MTProto protocol</a>: This is a roll-your-own protocol by Telegram (not a good idea).  All traffic is encrypted by MTProto Part I encryption, but this is only between the client device and the server.  Only secret chats are encrypted end to end using MTProto Part II.<br>
<br>
<a href="https://telegram.org/privacy#2-storing-data">Data storage</a>:
<ul>
  <li>Telegram stores regular cloud chats encrypted on their servers but they control all the encryption keys.</li>
  <li>All your contacts' phone numbers and names are stored on their servers.</li>
</ul>

Metadata leakage:<br>
- When you are online or not or whether the application is running or not is
  publicly viewable.<br>
- Who you talk to, when, and the precise time you send a message, and how frequently
  is publicly viewable via commandline tools.<br>
- If an attacker knows your phone number, the attacker will be able to silently log
  your Telegram activity without you knowing about it or being informed they have you
  as a contact.<br>

My verdict: Too many problems with the protocol and data storage!<br>
There are many issues with the protocol as shown by the referenced papers above.  Rolling your own crypto is hard and MTProto has many problems.<br>
Also all your phone contacts are stored on their servers, and non-secret chats are accessible to Telegram.<br>
