This is a peer-to-peer application but it is unique in that you can connect multiple devices to the same account and they will sync all data to all devices.  You can also choose to send data only to one specific device, making this a very nice file transfer platform.<br>
This application is still in beta (as of version 0.9.4, January 2018)<br>
Android leaks files: found photos in Local Storage/Device Storage/Sid/Sid Images.  Also leaks files on the Windows client.<br>

Encryption:<br>
<ul>
<li>Random numbers are generated using a Whirlpool512 hash with a 4096 bit entropy pool.</li>
<li>Diffie-Hellman key exchange using Curve25519</li>
<li>These keys are hashed to derive a shared secret</li>
<li>The shared secret is combined with a unique nonce to encrypt the message</li>
<li>Poly1305 is used to create a message authentication code</li>
</ul>
My verdict:<br>
<br>
I want to really love this app.  It combines P2P communication with syncing across multiple devices.  It also features sending files or messages to only one of your registered devices making this very nice for transferring files or notes between devices.  Also a plus is it is based in Germany.<br>
Unfortunately it leaks files like images that are sent.  So this would not be considered a secure messaging app.  However I do find it useful for sending files which already exist on my devices to other devices, since those files already are not encrypted or protected.<br>
