This is a peer-to-peer application but it is unique in that you can connect multiple devices to the same account and they will sync all data to all devices.  You can also choose to send data only to one specific device, making this a very nice file transfer platform.<br>
This application is still in beta (as of version 0.9.4, January 2018)
