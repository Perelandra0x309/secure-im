This is a peer-to-peer application but it is unique in that you can connect multiple devices to the same account and they will sync all data to all devices.  You can also choose to send data only to one specific device, making this a very nice file transfer platform.<br>
This application is still in beta (as of version 0.9.4, January 2018)<br>
My verdict:<br>
I am really loving this app.  It combines P2P communication with syncing across multiple devices.  It also features sending files or messages to only one of your registered devices making this very nice for transferring files or notes between devices.  Also a plus is it is based in Germany.<br>
