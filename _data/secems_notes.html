Trying to add a photo to the profile on Android just bring up a black screen with a spinning circle.<br>
Private vault and cloud is a nice feature.<br>
Everything seems to function just fine<br>

My verdict: Caution, Chinese app<br>
I would urge caution when using this application.  There is not a lot of information on the website about technical details, company info.  This company is registered in Beijing.  Without knowing more about the company I would stay away.<br>
