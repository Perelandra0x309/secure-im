<b>**Caution!!  This app is from a company based in China.</b><br>
<br>
Trying to add a photo to the profile on Android just bring up a black screen with a spinning circle.<br>
Private vault and cloud is a nice feature.<br>
Everything seems to function just fine<br>
<br>
My verdict: Do not download or use this app!<br>
There is not a lot of information on the website about technical details, company info.  This company is registered in Beijing.  Without knowing more about the company I would stay away.  China's recent technological spying on citizens makes any technology sourced from that country very suspect.<br>
