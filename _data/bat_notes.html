This app seems to be very well done, there were no issues encountered during testing.  You can send just about any type of file, and there are nice features such as timed messages, quoting messages, read receipts and message retraction.<br>

There isn't much info about the company behind this but they say they are based in Singapore.  There are not trackers found in the Android app which is nice.<br>
<br>
My verdict: Try it out, not sure of company origins<br>
<br>
Very feature complete and very fast sending messages.
