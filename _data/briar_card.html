<p>Briar is a peer to peer secure messenger that uses the Tor network for connecting devices.  Each Briar device has a unique onion address on the Tor network and there are no servers (besides the standard Tor infrastructure) needed to connect to other Briar users.  The app has fewer features than many messengers and is only available for Android but if you need secure communications this will provide that without unnecessary frills.</p>
