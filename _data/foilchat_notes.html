Features self destruct messages and deletion of messages from all devices.<br>
Sending a location shows up wrong for the recipient, when we tested it was not even in the right country.<br>
The missed call log creates duplicate entries each time you go into it.<br>
No notifications of new messages on Android without Google Play services.<br>
Most egregious of all is when registering your email becomes your ID.<br>
My verdict:<br>
While many of the bugs found can be fixed, there is no getting around the fact that your email address is exposed as your user ID.  That makes this app a no go for me.<br>
