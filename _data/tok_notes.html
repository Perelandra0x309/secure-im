Tok is a new client written to use the Tox transport protocol.<br>
Currently all profile data is stored in publicly accessible storage on Android so that makes this a no-go full stop.  There is an issue ticket <a href="https://github.com/InsightIM/Tok-Android/issues/9">(User profile information leaked to (essentially) every other app on Android)</a> about this where this issue is on their to do list.<br>
<br>
My verdict: Not yet<br>
<br>
The data leakage issue is serious, this is not even worth trying at this point until this basic security measure is resolved.<br>
