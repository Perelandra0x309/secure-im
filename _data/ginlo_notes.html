Ginlo was originally Developed by the Deutsche Post under the name SIMSme, then the app was transferred to Brabbler to maintain and was renamed Ginlo.<br>
The Ginlo encryption key is tied to the phone and cannot be transfered to another.  Requires a phone number to register.<br>
Invite contacts based on their phone number, email address or Ginlo ID.<br>
Self destructing messages can be set to auto delete from 1 to 60 seconds after being read or at a specific date and time that you choose.  There does not seem to be any restriction on choosing the date manually (except of course it must be in the future).  When receiving a self destruct message you must touch on the message and then touch and hold on the screen to view it.<br>
<br>
My verdict: Solid app to communicate with those who know your phone number<br>
This app is well done, didn't find any major issues with the app or functionality.  It offers great features like self destruct messages and delayed sending. This does require that your contacts know your phone number which is the only real drawback of this app.<br>
