Requires a phone number to register, add contacts using their phone number.<br>
Custom protocol- from the security overview:
<blockquote>
Viber’s protocol uses the same concepts of the “double ratchet” protocol used in
Open Whisper Systems Signal application, however, Viber’s implementation was
developed from scratch and does not share Signal’s source code.

The application is very functional, and video calling quality is very clear.  Unfortunately files are saved unencrypted on the data partition exposing pictures and possibly other data files. For example, /Android/daa/com.viber.voip/files/.thumbnails<br>

My Verdict:<br>
Do not use this application since it leaks message data.
