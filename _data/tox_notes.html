toxcore was <a href="https://tox.chat/download.html#toktok-c-toxcore">forked</a> to continue development<br>
Several clients are available and are developed independently of the core.<br>

<blockquote>
Information provided by JR<br>
<br>
What is leaked to the world:<br>
- Your IP address and the time you are online is revealed to your contacts. When chatting
  to another contact, you are connecting directly to them.<br>
- Tor activity for contact finding.<br>
- Not sure what else? There may be more. Going to have to read the documentation.

<br>
My verdict: Try it!<br>
Tox has a lot of promise, the clients need more polishing but they are available for most platforms which will help adoptability.<br>
