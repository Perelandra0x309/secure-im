toxcore was <a href="https://tox.chat/download.html#toktok-c-toxcore">forked</a> to continue development<br>
Several clients are available and are developed independently of the core: <a href="https://tox.chat/clients.html">Clients list</a>.<br>
<br>
Tox uses the <a href="https://linkcast.me/en/faq.php#qs-127">NaCl Box model</a> for encryption:<br>
<ul>
<li>Diffie-Hellman key exchange using Curve25519</li>
<li>These keys are hashed to derive a shared secret</li>
<li>The shared secret is combined with a unique nonce to encrypt the message</li>
<li>Poly1305 is used to create a message authentication code</li>
</ul>

What is leaked to the world:<br>
- Your IP address and the time you are online is revealed to your contacts. When chatting
  to another contact, you are connecting directly to them.<br>
- Tor activity for contact finding.<br>
- Not sure what else? There may be more. Going to have to read the documentation.

My verdict: Try it for non secure communications!<br>
<br>
Tox has a lot of promise, the clients need more polishing but they are available for most platforms which will help adoptability.<br>
Unfortunately the Antox client on Android leaks data, so this is a good option to try but I would not depend on it for secure communications.<br>
This shows the weakness of having a strong communication protocol but no control over the client apps.  The protocol may be excellent, but if the apps do not handle the information properly once decrypted, that compromises security.  And with multiple clients available, even if I choose a client that I know is secure, someone else I am communicating with may be using a client which is not secure so they are compromising my security.<br>
