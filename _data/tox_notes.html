toxcore was <a href="https://tox.chat/download.html#toktok-c-toxcore">forked</a> to continue development<br>
<br>
Several clients are available and are developed independently of the core: <a href="https://tox.chat/clients.html">Clients list</a>.<br>
<br>
Be careful on Android, Antox is listed on the official website as a client but it was last updated in 2018.  I found the client TRIfA on F-Droid which is very feature complete and recently updated.<br>
<br>
On the MacOS the qTox client works very well, and lets you choose where to save documents you receive from other Tox users.  This lets you choose and encrypted file system if you wish to protect these files.<br>
<br>
I was able to place a video call between TRIfA and qTox (on the same network).<br>
<br>
Tox uses the <a href="https://tox.chat/faq.html#tox-encryption-algorithm">NaCl Box model</a> for encryption:<br>
<ul>
<li>Diffie-Hellman key exchange using Curve25519</li>
<li>These keys are hashed to derive a shared secret</li>
<li>The shared secret is combined with a unique nonce to encrypt the message</li>
<li>Poly1305 is used to create a message authentication code</li>
</ul>

What is leaked to the world:<br>
- Your IP address and the time you are online is revealed to your contacts. When chatting
  to another contact, you are connecting directly to them.<br>
- Tor activity for contact finding.<br>
- Not sure what else? There may be more. Going to have to read the documentation.

<br>
My verdict: Try it!<br>
<br>
Tox has a lot of promise, the clients need more polishing but they are available for most platforms which will help adoptability.<br>
You may need to carefully test the clients you use and ask what clients your contacts are using to be sure these apps do not leak data.  The protocol may be excellent, but if the apps do not handle the information properly once decrypted, that compromises security.<br>
