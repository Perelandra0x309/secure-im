Riot <a href="https://about.riot.im/security/">Security</a> (E2EE still in beta)<br>
The web app can be used over Tor (thanks lwinch2006)<br>
<br>
My verdict: Great social platform<br>
Riot/Matrix is a great way to meet new people, and with E2EE (in beta) for individual and group chats it offers a way to go dark for private conversations.<br>
E2EE is still in the works and takes a bit of manual effort to get setup in chats, but that should be improving with time.
