Antox uses the {% include generate_app_link.html app_name="tox" %} protocol.<br>
<br>
On Copperhead, Antox needs battery optimizations set to Off to stay connected.<br>
Android leaks files: found photos in Local Storage/Device Storage/Download/Tox Received Files<br>
<br>
My verdict: Try it for non secure communications!<br>
<br>
Tox has a lot of promise, the clients need more polishing but they are available for most platforms which will help adoptability.<br>
Unfortunately the Antox client on Android leaks data, so this is a good option to try but I would not depend on it for secure communications.<br>
This shows the weakness of having a strong communication protocol but no control over the client apps.  The protocol may be excellent, but if the apps do not handle the information properly once decrypted, that compromises security.  And with multiple clients available, even if I choose a client that I know is secure, someone else I am communicating with may be using a client which is not secure so they are compromising my security.<br>
