Pix-Art is a fork of {% include generate_app_link.html app_name="conversations" %} with some slight modifications.  You also have the option of creating an XMPP account on their pix-art.de server which does not require an email address or phone number.<br>
<br>
When creating a new chat it is nice to see a notice describing how to enable encryption.  Settings are also laid out in a more organized manner than Conversations.  The settings are basically the same just easier to navigate.  In a chat session there are status check marks which make it easy to see when a message has been delivered (green check mark) and when it has also been read (green and blue check marks).<br>
<br>
The app requires a TLS connections to any XMPP server which is a nice security feature.<br>
<br>
Unfortunately Pix-Art has the same issues with saving images and files into public storage unencrypted that Conversations has.  Images are saved in &quot;Pix-Art Messenger/Media/Pix-Art Messenger Images&quot;, files are saved in &quot;Pix-Art Messenger/Media/Pix-Art Messenger Files&quot;.<br>
<br>
One area of concern is the process by which you can recover a lost password on an account on their server.  Because you do not specify an email address upon signup they do not have one on file, so this is their process:<br>
<li>Send me an e-mail stating your JID.</li>
<li>I will reset your old password and send you a new password via eMail</li>
<br>
They basically need to trust that you truly own that xmpp ID and email.  I see the possibility of someone who knows someone else's pix-art.de address email them and having a new password sent to their own email address, thus hijacking another person's pix-art.de xmpp account.<br>
<br>
My verdict: Tweaks make it easier to use than Conversations<br>
<br>
Just a few things here and there are enough to make this a more pleasant experience, however there are still some fundamental issues with the XMPP protocol that create security issues.<br>
