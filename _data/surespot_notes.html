Development seems to have ceased in May 2017.<br>

Surespot stores the following data on its servers:<br>
<ul>
<li>Usernames.</li>
<li>Friend relationships (who is friends with who, blocked who, ignored who, deleted who).</li>
<li>Conversation relationships (how many friends currently you have a "conversation" with - meaning have a sent or received a message with).</li>
<li>Messages in the amount of MAX_MESSAGES_PER_USER (currently 1000) which each have a server timestamp, to username, from username, and encrypted content, or link to encrypted content (image or file).</li>
<li>Encrypted message file data (image or other - anything but encrypted message content) is stored (encrypted in the same way text messages are) on rackspace cloud files.</li>
<li>Total messages sent per user.</li>
<li>Total images sent per user.</li>
<li>Current message count per user. (How many messages they have stored in the database currently, will always be <= MAX_MESSAGES_PER_USER (currently 1000)).</li>
<li>Signing (DSA) public keys and versions.</li>
<li>Encryption (DH) public keys and versions.</li>
<li>Encrypted "friend images" or avatars and friend aliases that are assigned to certain usernames. These are encrypted with a key generated from ECDH key derivation of assigning identity's private/public keypair.</li>
<li>Google GCM id (used for push messaging) which is related to the username in the surespot database.</li>
<li>Apple APN token (used for push messaging) which is related to the username in the surespot database.</li>
<li>If voice messaging is purchased, a purchase token given to us by Google or Apple which is related to the username in the surespot database.</li>
<li>Server logs may contain any of the above information and are in a 20 log - 5MB per log rotation.</li>
</ul>
<br>
My verdict:<br>
This is worth a try but not at the top of my list.  Some concerns are the amount of meta data stored on the server, and that the company is based in the US.<br>
