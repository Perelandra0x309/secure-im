This application requires a phone number to sign up, and also uses that number for other people to find and connect with you.<br>
Great support for all types of files.  The only thing that didn't work for me was sending my location which requires Google Play services.<br>
The web application connects to your phone with a QR code, new messages sync to both devices. However there is no history synced to the web application when it connects.<br>
There are ads dispersed throughout the application.<br>
One tester had the app freeze up on iOS after it asked for a rating at the app store and even a reinstall of the app could not restore functionality.<br>
<br>
My verdict: Too many ads and data trackers<br>
Overall the app works well and is very functional.  The ads are a disappointment, and there are a total of 13 trackers used in this app.<br>
Requires people to know your phone number for connecting with people, there are better apps to use if this is how you choose to identify yourself.<br>
