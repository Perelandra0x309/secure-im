This application requires a phone number to sign up, and also uses that number for other people to find and connect with you.<br>
Great support for all types of files.  The only thing that didn't work for me was sending my location which requires Google Play services.<br>
The web application connects to your phone with a QR code, new messages sync to both devices. However there is no history synced to the web application when it connects.<br>
There are ads dispersed throughout the application.<br>
One tester had the app freeze up on iOS after it asked for a rating at the app store and even a reinstall of the app could not restore functionality.<br>

Encryption (<a href="https://soma.im/faq?lang=en#q-how-do-you-encrypt-data">FAQ</a>):<br>
When a user starts a new message, the sending device generates a random 256-bit key and encrypts the message with it using AES in CBC mode. The dynamically generated public RSA 2048-bit encryption keys are then retrieved from the server to encrypt this per-message AES key. The retrieve public keys will be further verified on the sending device to prevent man-in-the-middle attack. The combination of the encrypted message and the encrypted message key is then hashed with SHA-1 to ensure the integrity of the message body.<br>

My verdict: Too many ads and data trackers<br>
Overall the app works well and is very functional.  The ads are a disappointment, and there are a total of 13 trackers used in this app.<br>
Requires people to know your phone number for connecting with people, there are better apps to use if this is how you choose to identify yourself.<br>
