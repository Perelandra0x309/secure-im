This application requires a phone number to sign up, and also uses that number for other people to find and connect with you.<br>
Great support for all types of files.  The only thing that didn't work for me was sending my location which requires Google Play services.<br>
The web application connects to your phone with a QR code, new messages sync to both devices. However there is no history synced to the web application when it connects.<br>
There are ads dispersed throughout the application.<br>
One tester had the app freeze up on iOS after it asked for a rating at the app store and even a reinstall of the app could not restore functionality.<br>
<br>
My verdict:<br>
Overall the app works well and is very functional.  The ads distract a little from the enjoyment of the app.<br>
Only useful for connecting with people you are comfortable giving your phone number to, so within that parameter this app is worth a try.<br>
