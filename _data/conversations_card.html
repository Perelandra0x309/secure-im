<p>Conversations uses the OMEMO protocol to encrypt messages.  There is more meta data saved on the servers than many messengers, but that can be mitigated by self hosting your own XMPP server.  However that does take a lot of skill and time to manage your own server.  If you do not self host, that will bring my score for privacy of your messages down to a 2.</p>

<br>
Pros:
<ul>
<li>If you self host you control all the information on your own server</li>
<li>Communicate in one on one and group text chats</li>
<li>There are many servers to choose from if you don't want to host your own</li>
<li>If you self host or choose a good server you do not have to provide email or other identifying information</li>
<li>Some servers offer the ability to use Tor</li>
<li>Messages are preserved if you move to another device or use multiple devices with the same account</li>
</ul>
Cons:
<ul>
<li>Android only</li>
<li>OMEMO encryption is an add-on to a system not designed with privacy in mind from the beginning</li>
<li>More difficult to use than many messengers</li>
<li>More meta data is saved on the servers than many messengers (which is why self-hosting is recommended)</li>
<li>Not encrypted by default- you must actively enable OMEMO encryption</li>
<li>No ephemeral messages</li>
</ul>
Other features:
<ul>
<li>Use the same account on multiple devices</li>
<li>Send photos, audio, files and videos</li>
<li>Quote a message when replying</li>
<li>Edit your most recent message</li>
<li>Use multiple XMPP accounts at once on the same device</li>
<li>Delivery and read receipts in individual chats</li>
<li>Contact verification through key fingerprint comparison</li>
</ul>
