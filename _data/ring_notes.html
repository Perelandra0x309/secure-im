Pros:<br>
On F-Droid<br>
Multiple platforms<br>
Not dependent on a phone #<br>
Cons:<br>
Android and Mac app still have some usability issues, just out of beta<br>
<br>
My verdict: Worth a try!<br>
This is being developed as a side project by Savoir-faire Linux so they know open source!  The clients have a unified experience and are available for most platforms.<br>
This was designed as a P2P app, so messages you send are not synced between your multiple clients.  However messages sent to you do appear on all your clients, making a somewhat confusing stream of conversation when using multiple clients.<br>
The primary purpose of Ring is for video calling, but messaging (to individuals) does work.
