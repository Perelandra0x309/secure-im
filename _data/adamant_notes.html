Adamant is a messaging app that is based on blockchain technology.  Messages are encrypted and stored onto the blockchain which is stored in duplicate on many computers connected to the internet.  The advantage of this is that your messages are accessible to you anywhere from any device.  You can also leave a message for someone else on the blockchain and they can be offline and retrieve it later.  One big disadvantage of this system is that your messages (while encrypted) are stored in permanance.  So while the encryption methods used now are secure they may not be in the future and all your messages may be decripherable.<br>

This application is also very immature in that is has few features outside of texting and cryptocurrency exchange.  At this time it is not mature enough to use as a primary messaging system.<br>
<br>
My verdict: Limited use, future security concerns<br>
<br>
Lack of basic features like sending photos and group chat make this a very limited use app, and having messages live permanantly on a blockchain is not a good security habit.<br>
