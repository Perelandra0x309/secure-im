Works over Tor. Creates a <a href="https://www.torproject.org/docs/hidden-services.html.en">hidden Tor service</a> to connect P2P.<br>
Is this still in active development?- <a href="https://github.com/ricochet-im/ricochet/issues/555">Yes</a><br>
<br>
Encryption:<br>
The built in encryption in Tor hidden services is used, Diffie-Hellman key exchange with RSA 1024 keys.<br>
<a href="https://gitweb.torproject.org/torspec.git/tree/rend-spec-v3.txt">From the spec:</a>For legacy purposes, we specify compatibility with older versions of the Tor introduction point and rendezvous point protocols. These used RSA1024, DH1024, AES128, and SHA1, as discussed in rend-spec.txt.<br>
<br>
Ricochet is consider <a href="https://github.com/ricochet-im/ricochet">experimental</a>.  Do not use for anything you want to truely be secure.<br>
<blockquote>
This software is an experiment. Security and anonymity are difficult topics, and you should carefully evaluate your risks and exposure with any software. Do not rely on Ricochet for your safety unless you have more trust in my work than it deserves. That said, I believe it does more to try to protect your privacy than any similar software, and is the best chance you have of withholding your personal information.

My verdict: Nice concept to try<br>
I love that it is based on Tor hidden services.  I hope that development continues to increase in pace and we see more updates soon.<br>
Note that this is sill considered an experimental project.
