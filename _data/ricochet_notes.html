Works over Tor. Creates a <a href="https://www.torproject.org/docs/hidden-services.html.en">hidden Tor service</a> to connect P2P.<br>
Is this still in active development?- <a href="https://github.com/ricochet-im/ricochet/issues/555">Yes</a><br>
<br>
Encryption:<br>
The built in encryption in Tor hidden services is used, Diffie-Hellman key exchange with RSA 1024 keys.<br>
<br>
My verdict: Great option for desktops, mobiles coming soon?<br>
I love that it is based on Tor hidden services.  I hope that development continues to increase in pace and we see more updates soon.<br>
Note that this is sill considered an experimental project.
