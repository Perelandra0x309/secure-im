title: Apps to use on multiple devices
---

If you want the convenience of being able to move from one device to another and continue your chats where you left off, then there are only two apps that I feel have excellent quality and security.  These are:<br>
<ul>
<li>{% include generate_app_link.html app_name="wire" %}</li>
  Pros:
  <ul>
  <li>Very nice look, lots of features</li>
  <li>Communicate with text, voice, video or group text chat</li>
  <li>You can optionally set messages to automatically delete up to 4 weeks after delivery</li>
  <li>You can login to the Wire website and chat from any computer</li>
  <li>Based in Switzerland (great privacy laws)</li>
  </ul>
  Cons:
  <ul>
  <li>You need to provide an email or phone number to create an account. But this information is never given to any of your contacts.</li>
  </ul>
  <a href="#installwire" class="btn btn--info btn--x-large">Install Wire</a><br>
  <br>
<li>{% include generate_app_link.html app_name="wickrme" %}</li>
  Pros:
  <ul>
  <li>Communicate with text, audio and group text chat</li>
  <li>All messages automatically delete up to 6 days after delivery</li>
  <li>No personal information such as an email address or phone number is needed to create an account</li>
  </ul>
  Cons:
  <ul>
  <li>Doesn't have as many features as Wire</li>
  <li>Video chat is not available in the personal free version</li>

  </ul>

<h2 id="installwire">Install Wire</h2>
You can signup with Wire using either an email address or a phone number.  This information is only used by you to login to the app, this information is not shared with any of your contacts.  If you are not comfortable giving out this information to Wire, then I would recommend that you instead <a class="btn btn--info btn--x-large" href="#installwickrme">Install WickrMe</a><br>
<br>
Choose which method you want to use to signup:<br>
<table width="90%" border="2">
<tr>
<td valign="top" width="50%"><b style="font-size: 1.3em;">Use an email address:</b>
<ul>
<li>First <a href="https://app.wire.com/auth/#createaccount" class="btn btn--success btn--x-large" target="_blank">Register at their website</a></li>
<li>Next <a href="https://wire.com/en/download/" class="btn btn--success btn--x-large" target="_blank">Download and install Wire</a> on the computer or phone you wish to use it on.</li>
<li>Log into the app using your email address and password.</li>
</ul>
</td>
<td valign="top" width="50%"><b style="font-size: 1.3em;">Use a phone number:</b>
<ul>
<li>On your phone <a href="https://wire.com/en/download/" class="btn btn--success btn--x-large" target="_blank">Download and install Wire</a> from the Android Play Store or the Apple App Store.</li>
<li>Register for Wire using the app</li>
<li>Log into the app using your phone number and password.</li>
</ul>
<br>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<br>
Once you have Wire installed and you are signed in, one of the first things you should do is disable usage and crash reports.  This is additional information sent to the Wire company about how you use the app and information about app crashes.  This is optional and reducing the amount of information you send helps improve your privacy.  To disable this feature follow these steps:
<ul>
<li>Click on your photo in the top left corner of the Wire app</li>
<li>Select "Settings", then "Account", then "Data Usage Permissions"</li>
<li>Turn off the toggle switch next to "Send Anonymous Data"</li>
<li>While there you can also disable the option to "Receive Newsletter" if you do not want that.</li>
</ul>
<br>
One great feature of Wire is "Timed Messages".  These are messages that will automatically delete after a set amount of time from all devices that the message was sent to.  If you do not care to keep a complete history of all your chat sessions then it is a good idea to set your messages to delete, otherwise they may sit around on any device potentially forever.  Cleaning up information you don't need any more is another good privacy habit.  To enable timed messages, enter an existing chat session you have with someone.  To the right of where you type your message you will see a little stopwatch icon.  Click on this and you can set how long you want a message to stay around until it is automatically deleted.  You can choose varous timeframes up to 4 weeks.  I usually set mine to 4 weeks, so if I do need to go back to an older message I have 4 weeks to do so.  I wish it were a little longer but you can only choose the options the app gives you.<br>

<h2 id="installwickrme">Install WickrMe</h2>
You do not need to provide any personal information to signup for a WickrMe account.<br>
<br>
Go to the website to <a href="https://me-download.wickr.com" class="btn btn--success btn--x-large" target="_blank">Download and install WickrMe</a><br>
<br>
The default settings of WickrMe are fine to use.  There are some extra security features like adding PIN numbers or fingerprint access which you can explore in the settings.<br>
<br>
To the left of the box where you type in a message is a stopwatch icon which when touched brings up the options to set the message auto-destruct timer.  You have several options from 6 hours up to 6 days.  Note that this feature is not optional, all messages in WickrMe will auto-destruct.<br>
