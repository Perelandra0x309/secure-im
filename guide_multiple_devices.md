title: Apps to use on multiple devices

If you want the convenience of being able to move from one device to another and continue your chats where you left off, then there are only three apps that I feel have excellent quality and security.  These are:<br>
<table>
{% include install_wire_row.md %}
{% include install_wickrme_row.md %}
{% include install_keybase_row.md %}
</table>

<br>
Did you change your mind?  Do you want to use a messaging app on only one device?  Then you can follow this guide:<br>
