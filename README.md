## Site info

This site is built with Jekyll and hosted on GitHub pages.  The theme used is a custom theme I wrote using <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/w3css/">W3.CSS</a>.
Javascript is used sparingly, on the two pages with charts it allows for dynamic filtering of the data.  I use the HTML Table Filter Generator from <a href="http://tablefilter.free.fr">http://tablefilter.free.fr</a>.

Data for each application is stored in the _data/applications.yml file and in each application's *_notes.html file.
