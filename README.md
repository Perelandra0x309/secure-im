This site is built with Jekyll and hosted on GitHub pages.  The theme used is <a href="https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/">Minimal Mistakes</a>.<br>
Javascript is used sparingly, on the two pages with charts it allows for dynamic filtering of the data.  I use the HTML Table Filter Generator from <a href="http://tablefilter.free.fr">http://tablefilter.free.fr</a>.<br>

If you find errors or wish to contribute data please create an Issue or a Pull Request with your updates.  Any information that improves this list is greatly appreciated.<br>
Data for each application is stored in the _data/applications.yml file and in each application's *_notes.html file.
