With most of the world now staying at home, many people are looking for ways to maintain connections with friends and family.  Be careful which products you use, not all are safe.  Here are my recommendations based on knowledge of the technologies these products use and my personal experience.  In choosing these products I am looking for something that is:

- Secure: Your private information won't be leaked to third party companies, internet hackers or other participants in your meetings.
- Easy to use: Something that you can use with family members without being called on for frequent technical support.
- Cross platform and device support: People choose their own technology to use.  The product should be usable across a wide range of operating systems and on phones, laptops and desktop computers.
- Free or very low cost
