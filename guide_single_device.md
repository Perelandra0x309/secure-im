title: Apps to use on a single device
---
These seven apps have excellent quality and security if you only need to use one device.  Wire, WickrMe and Keybase can be used with a single device but can also be used on multiple devices, so if you do choose to start using multiple devices in the future those apps will make that transition easy.<br>
